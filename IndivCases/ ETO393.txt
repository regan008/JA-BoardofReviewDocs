1.	The record of trial in the case of the soldiers named above has been examined in the Branch Office of The Judge Advocate General with the European Theater of Operations and there found legally insufficient in part to support the findings. The record has now been examined by the Board of Review which submits this, its holding, to the Assistant Judge Advocate General in charge of said office.

CHARGE II:	Violation	of the 96th Article of War.
Specification: In that Technician Fourth Grade Paul R. Caton and Technician Fifth Grade Morris R. Fikes, bpth of 3rd Station Hospital, did at Tidworth, Hants, England, on or about 9 January 1943, while acting jointly and in pursuance of a common purpose, wrongfully and without lawful permission or authority take and use an ambulance, No, 719144, the property of the United States and of the value of more than fifty dollars ($50.00).
CHARGE III: Violation of the 93rd Article of War. Specification: In that Technician Fourth Grade Paul R, Caton and Technician Fifth Grade Morris R, Fikes, both of 3rd Station Hospital, did near Salisbury, Wiltshire, England, on or about 9 January 1943, while acting jointly and in pursuance of a common purpose, feloniously and unlawfully kill Private William Pitson of the British Army by driving a United States Army ambulance in a grossly negligent and reckless ' manner to wit, to the right of the center of the highway, and at night with only one light, into a British motor vehicle in which the said Private Pitson was riding.
Each accused pleaded not guilty to and was found guilty of all Specifications and Charges. No evidence of previous convictions was introduced. They were sentenced, each, to be dishonorably discharged the service, to forfeit all pay and allowances due or to become due, and to be confined, at hard labor for three years at such place as the reviewing authority may direct. The reviewing authority approved the sentence as to each accused but suspended the execution of the dishonorable discharge until the soldier's release from confinement and designated the Disciplinary Training Center No. 1, Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England, as the place of confinement.
The result of the trial was promulgated in General Court-Martial Order No. 8, Headquarters, Southern Base Section, Services of Supply, European Theater of Operations, United States Army, APO 519, dated 3 April 1943.
3.	The evidence of witnesses for the prosecution and of witnesses called by the court, shows that on 9 January 1943, about 7:30 P.M., Private W. Davies, A.T.S., (British) met. the accused Caton at a noncommissioned officers' bar at Tidworth, England. There they had a drink and a dance. * Private Davies,(female), who had come to Tidworth from Salisbury, did not return to Salisbury on the last bus which left about 9:25 P.M. Caton promised that he would obtain transportation to Salisbury for her, and said that he would "go to the
(327)
office and ask permission" (R.3-4). On the evening of 9 January 194-3, Technician 4-th Grade Samuel W. Hess, was on duty in the dispatch office as a dispatcher and transportation sergeant for the 3rd Station Hospital, and was in charge of dispatching all vehicles of the hospital (R.1,20). On that evening, Caton asked Hess for permission to take^vehicle to Salisbury. Hess testified that he told Caton that he was not authorized to grant him permission, and that Caton should see Captain Becker, the transportation officer. Hess did not see the accused Fikes (R.1,7,20),	Private John II. Lewis, on duty with Hess
in the transportation office, testified that Hess told Caton that "he could have an ambulance as long as he could find a driver and he (Hess) didn't know anything about it" (R.7). Hess denied making any such statement (R.2).
On 7 January 194-3, ambulance No. 719144-, property of the United States, was assigned for military use at the 3rd Station Hospital (R.17-18).	Permission for the use of vehicles was granted
only by the dispatch office (R.2), and it was required that trip tickets be issued at that office even if permission for the use of a vehicle came from higher authority (R.19). Only Hess or Captain Becker, the transportation officer, could have authorized the use of ambulance No. 719144 on 9 January 1943. No ambulance would be dispatched unless a call came from the admission and disposition office, or unless Captain Becker or the commanding officer granted permission (R.lo). Hess did not dispatch a vehicle to either of the accused on the evening of 9 January 1943 (R.l). A trip ticket was not issued for ambulance No. 719144 on that evening, nor was it dispatched or its use then authorized (R.18-19). About 12:30 o'clock, as the result of a telephone call, Hess found that ambulance No. 719144 was missing (R.19). The vehicle had been parked in front of the transportation office, and could have been driven away without the knowledge of Hess. (R.20-21).
According to Private Davies, Caton had difficulty in obtaining a driver. lie got Fikes to drive for him. She did not know where the vehicle was first obtained as it was too dark (R.4). After the ambulance v*as obtained, Caton and Fikes entered "an office". Private Davies "understood Sergeant Caton to say that he would take the risk" during his conversation with Fikes (R.6,23,25).	Private Davies with
Fikes and Caton then left in the vehicle for Salisbury (R.4,6,24). Private Davies sat in the front seat with Fikes who was driving.
After they reached Amesbury, Private Davies sat in the rear of the ambulance with Caton, and Fikes drove on, sitting alone in the front seat (R.5,23-25).	'	On	the	way	to	Amesbury,	according to Private
Davies, Fikes had driven carefully, seemed.like a competent driver, handled the vehicle in a proper manner and drove on the correct side of the road (R.5,25). About three miles beyond Amesbury there was a collision with another vehicle. Private Davies and Caton then got out of the ambulance. About four occupants of the other vehicle were injured, one seriously. Fikes was injured and had blood on his face
393
T'
(328) v"
(R,4,24-25). As Private Davies was riding in the rear of the vehicle at the time of the accident, she could not see the road, and did not know in what manner Fikes wa,s driving. The ambulance "did not seem to be going at a terrific rate though" (R.5,25)•
Driver Clifford Cochram,(British), 63rd Troop Carrying Unit,
Royal Army Service Corps, was, on 9 January 1943, detailed to take a vehicle from Salisbury to Bulford. He left Salisbury about 2300 hours, and, after travelling two miles, noticed a bright light coming towards him (R.26). He did not know what, the one light was, and thought it might be a motorcycle (R.28). Cochram slowed up to about fifteen miles per hour, changed to third gear, and pulled well over to his own side of the road. The light was about six yards away when he realized it was a vehicle which had no offside light (R.26-28). The next thing Cochram knew, an American ambulance struck his vehicle on its offside mudguard, and then struck the bodywork. Cochram was stunned, lost the control of his car and the steering wheel was ripped out of hi3 hands. Prior to the accident, the American ambulance was about two feet over on Cochram1s side of the "white line" (R.26-27). Prior to the collision Cochram had applied his brakes but did not blow his horn (R.28). When he left Salisbury, Cochram had checked the two side lights and one headlight on his vehicle and found them to be in good working order (R.28). He had been driving for five years, and had had no accidents (R.27). He wore glasses to correct short-sightedness, and could see "perfectly clearly" with them. Cochram was wearing glasses at the time of the accident (R.28).
Driver C. M. Pearse, 253rd Troop Carrying Unit, Royal Army Service Corps, was riding in the front seat with Cochram at the time of the accident. They were driving on the correct side of the road and in a normal manner. A single light approached about 100 yards away.
"V«e had assumed this light to be a motorcycle but in actual fact it was an American ambulance. He hit us and we came to a standstill ***".
Asked by the prosecution how far the. American ambulance was over the center line t>f the road just prior to the impact, Pearse stated "Actually we could not see it until it was on us, but from the mere fact that it did hit us *** we were on the correct side" (R.29-31)• When the accident occurred, the British vehicle had just passed over the crest of a hill, was in third gear, and was travelling at 15 miles per hour. The night v/as wet and it was "drizzling" when they left Salisbury. Pearse thought it was drizzling after the accident. The wind shield wiper on the British vehicle was operating (R.30).
At the place where the accident occurred, the road was straight but towards Amesbury there was a "very slight bend" (R.8). The road was 22 feet wide and the width _of the British vehicle v/as 7 feet 7 inches at its widest point. There was ample room for the two vehicles to pass (R.ll). A white line divided the road (R.13). After the accident the wheel marks of the British vehicle were plainly visible. They "were right in against the grass verge thirty (30) yards prior to the accident and it came to rest at the time of the collision v/ith the v/heels still hard against the grass verge. At no tine was that vehicle away from the grass verge leading up to the *** or at the collision" (R.ll,13,27,31)•
393
- 4 -
(329)
There was no indication of tire marks made by the American ambulance (R.11,13). An inspection of the American vehicle after the accident disclosed that its number was 719144 (R.32), and that then "it had not any offside light" (Ex."C"). The American vehicle was damaged "from the front off mudguard back from the driver's cab to the body". The cab was badly damaged and the windshield was smashed (R.9,11,32).	The
British vehicle had been struck on its offside mudguard (R,ll,26) which was partly ripped off (R.ll). An expert witness was of the opinion that the cost of repairing the American ambulance would be about 100 pounds (R.36),
The visibility on the evening in question "was not good but was not exceptionally bad". In the opinion of one witness, with lights "visibility at two hundred yards would have beer* adequate" (R.32).
Another witness testified it was rather dark, and that there was a very slight rain (R,12). A third witness testified that the atmosphere was "rather heavily laden" (Ex."C").
As a result of the accident, Fikes and three or four occupants of the British vehicle, including the deceased, Pitson, were injured.
They were taken to the hospital by a civilian in a private car (R.24, 37-39, 45-4o> Ex."A"), .Before leaving the scene of the accident,
Fikes was asked by an English soldier how the accident had occurred.
Fikes replied that he "could not see a thing" (R.365 Ex."C"). Pitson died at 4*30 A.S3., 10 January 194-3 (Ex."A"). When given medical treatment Fikes aid not appear to be intoxicated (Ex."A"). At the time of the accident, Pitson, the deceased, was sitting in the front seat on the right-hand side of the British vehicle. The seats were installed with a center row of seats and a row of seats on either side of the truck running lengthwise. He was knocked unconscious (R.45-47).
The switch system on the American ambulance was inspected by the regular driver of the vehicle on 7 and 8 January 194-3, but not on 9 January. The vehicle was, at 5:30 P.M., as far as the driver knew,
"in good shape". With reference to the ignition system, "there is a little button by the headlight switch, *** as you turn it on at any time and the lighting switch is pulled out on the same thing". If the headlights were turned on, the sidelights would automatically come on (R.21-22).
4-. The evidence for the defense shows that the American ambulance was received 7 January 19-43 (Pros.Ex."B"). The lights were checked and it was found to be in good operating condition. If the headlight was turned on the side-lights would be lighted. On a dark night without fog, the running light could be seen from five to six hundred feet.
Fikes was a licensed driver (R.40).
Captain Edwin C. Miller, MAC., testifiecjihat he had known Caton since April 1942, that at first he was a cook, and that Caton had done an "excellent job" when he was in charge of subsistence, Caton never gave a moment's trouble and Captain Miller could not recall that he had
393
(330)
ever been late at formation. Fikes had also been under the captain's supervision for about two months. His work had been very satisfactory.
(R.42).
First Lieutenant John T. Scarborough, Chaplain, had known the accused for about 11 months. They were very dependable, reliable and courteous (R.4-3).
Accused, after being advised of their rights, elected to remain silent (R.44)•
5.	With reference to Charge II and the Specification thereunder (wrongfully and without authority taking and using the vehicle alleged while acting jointly and in pursuance of a common purpose), the Board of Review is of the opinion that the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain the findings of guilty as to each accused. Caton asked Hess for permission to drive a vehicle to Salisbury. His request was refused and Caton was told that he would have to see Captain Becker, the transportation officer. However, in spite of this refusal, 'Caton wrongfully took the ambulance. After having had some difficulty in getting a driver, and finally obtaining Fikes, the ambulance was driven away without authority. Contrary to regular orders, no trip ticket was secured from the dispatch office. Permission to use the vehicle was not granted by Hess, Captain Becker or by higher or other competent authority. The court was entitled to disbelieve, as apparently it did, the testimony of Private Lewis to the effect that Hess told Caton that
he could have an ambulance if he could find a driver and if Hess knew nothing about it, and to believe the testimony of Hess who denied having made the statement.
The finding by the court that Fikes was also guilty of the offense alleged in this Specification is supported by the evidence. Private Davies heard Caton tell Fikes that he (Caton) "would take the risk", indicating that Fike3 knew that the contemplated use of the vehicle was unauthorized. In addition, Fikes was a licensed driver and it may be justifiably assumed that he knew it would be necessary to secure permission for the use of any vehicle, and to follow the usual procedure of obtaining a trip ticket from the dispatch office. It was also evident that as licensed driver, Fikes should have been especially careful to ascertain whether such a trip ticket had been obtained because of the unusual circumstances of the request to drive and of taking the vehicle. Although there was no evidence as to the value of the ambulance, considering the type of vehicle concerned, the assumption that its value was in excess of &50 as alleged, is fully warranted.
6.	With reference to Charge III and the Specification thereunder, (offense of manslaughter while acting jointly and in pursuance of a common purpose), the evidence shows that on the evening in question, -visibility "was not good but was not exceptionally bad".. It was dark.
The atmosphere was "rather heavily laden", and there was a very slight rain. Cochram, the driver of the British vehicle, observed a bright
393
' n	(331)
light approaching. Not knowing whether it was a motorcycle or automobile, he changed to third gear, slowed up to about fifteen miles per hour and pulled well over on his own side of the road. He did not realize that it was an automobile until the light was about six yards away. The offside light of the vehicle was not burning. The American ambulance was about two feet over on the wrong side of the white line, and struck the British vehicle on the latter's offside mudguard. After the accident occurred, the tire marks of the British vehicle were plainly seen against the grass verge for a distance *of thirty yards before coming to the place of collision, thus showing that Cochram was well over "on his own side" of the road when the accident occurred. The witness who inspected the American ambulance after the collision, then found that "it had not any offside light". He asked Fikes how the accident happened and Hikes replied that he "could not see a thing". (Underscoring supplied).
The offense charged is that of involuntary manslaughter.
"Involuntary manslaughter is homicide unintentionally caused in the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony, nor likely to endanger life, or by culpable negligence in performing a lawful act, or in performing an act required by law", (par. 149a, M.C.M.,
pp.165-166)•
"The degree of negligence necessary to be shown in a prosecution for involuntary manslaughter, based upon an unintentional killing by a motor vehicle, is more than is required on the trial of an issue of negligence in a civil action. The general rule is that negligence, to become criminal, must necessarily be reckless or wanton and of such a character as to show an utter disregard of the safety of others under circumstances likely to cause injuries".
(Blashfield, Cyclopedia of Automobile Law and Practice, Vol.8, pp.108-109).
»***# At common law, one causing death'by negligent driving is not criminally responsible unless the negligence is so great that the law imputes a criminal intent. A motor vehicle is not a deadly or inherently dangerous instrumentality, so as to impose liability for mere carelessness in its use or operation, and the degree of negligence necessary to support a conviction is such recklessness
i ••rl-
393
or carelessness as Is Incompatible with a proper regard for human life. It Is sufficient, however, if It reasonably appears that death or great bodily harm was likely to result from the driver's consent, (conduct)", (sec,1380, 42 C.J., pp.1356-1357). (Underscoring supplied).
It is alleged in the Specification that the death of Pitson occurred because the ambulance was driven "in a grossly negligent and reckless manner to-wit, to the right of the center of the highway and at night with only one light ***". In view of the fact that Fikes was driving the ambulance in inclement weather without his offside light, that he admitted he could not see a thing, that the ambulance was about two feet over the white dividing line immediately prior to the collision; that the British vehicle, when struck, was being driven about fifteen miles per hour in third gear at a slow speed along the edge of the grass verge, well within its own side of the road, and that the ambulance hit the British vehicle at the latter's offside mudguard, it is the opinion of the Board of Review that the evidence is legally sufficient to reasonably justify the finding by the court that the vehicle was driven in the manner alleged, and that Fikes was, as a consequence, guilty of involuntary manslaughter.
The question remaining for consideration is whether or not the evidence was legally sufficient to sustain the findings that Caton was also guilty of this offense. It was clearly established by the evidence that Caton took the ambulance for his 07m purposes. It was indicated that Fikes, who agreed to operate the vehicle, did so with knowledge that its use was unauthorized as Caton told him that he, Caton, "would take the risk". Although the unauthorized taking was primarily for Caton's benefit, both accused were knowingly engaged in a wrongful, joint enterprise.
With reference to cases involving civil liability arising as the result of an automobile collision, the fact that the accused were engaged in a joint enterprise, materially affects the liability of an occupant of a vehicle for the negligence of the operator of that vehicle.
"Where persons are associated together in the execution of a common purpose and undertaking, it has been held that each is the agent of the others in carrying out their plans, so that the negligence of one is attributable to the others." (sec. 5.158 Berry Automobiles, 7th Ed.,
Vol.5, p.206).
"One who is riding in a motor vehicle who is neither the owner nor the person actually operating it is not liable for injuries occasioned by its negligent operation where he 303 is exercising no control over it or of the	4
- 8
I
(333)
driver, and where there has been no act or omission upon his part constituting negligence.
'where, however, the occupant and the driver are enpaged in a joint- enterprise, the occunant is equally liable with the driver for the negligence of the driver.” (sec.886.
42 G.J., p.1123). (Underscoring supplied).
11 Two boys who borrow an automobile and take two girls riding are engaged in a joint enterprise, in which each has equal control over the operation of the vehicle, and the wantonness of the driver in colliding with a buggy and killing one of its occupants is imputable to his associate, who at the time of the accident is riding in the rear seat of the automobile." (Howard v. Zimmerman,
120 Kan. 77, 242 Pac. 131, footnote 21a,
.42 C.J., p.1123).
"Where house guest of automobile owner unlawfully appropriated automobile, despite warning not to touch it, and induced other house guests to ride with him, other guests were not his ’guests’ in the automobile, but were ’joint tort-feasors’ in appropriating the automobile, and automobile was in their ’joint possession’ so as to make them liable for resulting injuries.- Jones v, Kasper, 33
N.E.2d, 816". (sec.886, 1942 Annotations,
C.J., p.3939).
"The joint possession of automobile by one unlawfully in possession and others whom he induced to ride with him warranted inference of ’joint control’, and hence cross-relationship of ’principal’ and ’agent’ existed among the occupants and nondriving occupants were chargeable with driver's negligence.- Jones v. Kasper, 33 N.E.2d 816".
(sec.886, 1942 Annotations, C.J., p.3939).
This principle equally applies in cases involving criminal offenses:
"It has been held that a person may commit the offense of reckless driving, although not actually in control of the car at the time of the alleged violation", (sec.1270,
42 C.J., p.1323.)	£>•
Cu.’ii'ULNll int
"Where several persons agreed to take an automobile without consent of the owner for a ride on a public highway, and the machine was operated recklessly, they were held guilty of reckless driving, it being of no consequence which particular one was at the steering wheel at the time.11 (State v. Davis, 88 S.C. 229, 70 S.E. 811, footnote 81a, 42 C.J., p.1323). (Underscoring supplied).
As the element of intent is not involved in the dfense of involuntary manslaughter under consideration, but that of negligence only, the negligence of Fikes may be imputed to Caton, not on the basis of principal and agent nor of master and servant, but because Caton and Fikes were joint venturers in a joint enterprise.
There is a further and different basis on which the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain the findings that Caton, as well as Fikes, was responsible for the death of Pitson:
"One who participates in or is responsible for the reckless operation of a motor vehicle may be guilty of the offense, although not actually in control of the car." (sec.1273*
42 C.J., p.1323). (Underscoring supplied).
Caton, without authorization, took the vehicle exclusively for his own purposes, and controlled its destination. Also, he was the superior in rank of Fikes who, as a licensed driver, apparently volunteered to operate the vehicle purely as a favor to Caton, who assured Fikes that he would take the risk. Under such circumstances, Caton was chargeable with responsibility for the operation of the ambulance, which responsibility entailed among other things the duty of seeing that it was properly driven, Caton’s failure to perform this duty, coupled with the negligent driving of Fikes, caused Pitson’s death. It is not known whether the court based its findings of Caton’s guilt upon the basis of a joint enterprise or upon the theory last mentioned. Under either view, the evidence is legally sufficient to sustain the findings that Caton was guilty of Charge III and of the Specification thereunder,
7.	With reference to Charge I and Specification thereunder, it is alleged in substance that the accused, while acting jointly and in pursuance of a common purpose, through neglect suffered the ambulance to be damaged in the amount of $100 by driving the same in a negligent and reckless manner. The evidence is legally sufficient to sustain the findings that Fikes was guilty of this offense,
i
The 83rd Article of War provides, in pertinent part, that:
393
- 10
v
(335)
Uu.'i. ■ - .. '
11 Any person subject to military law who *** through neglect, suffers to be *** damaged,
*** any military property belonging to the United States shall *** suffer such punishment as a court-martial may direct."
Neglect is defined as follows:
v "To omit, as to neglect business, or payment, or duty, or work. It does not generally imply carelessness or imprudence, but simply an omission to do or perform some work. duty or act9 * 11. (Bouvier's Law Dictionary,
Unabridged, Rawls’s Third Revision, Vol.2, p.2312), (Underscoring supplied).
In paragraph 143> M.C.M., p,158, it is stated that the "*** neglectful sufference specified by the Article may consist in *** permitting it to be *** injured by other persons". As has been previously stated herein, for the reasons indicated, Caton was charged with the responsibility of seeing that the vehicle was properly driven, and of exercising such supervisory control as to ensure this fact. He omitted to perform that duty* As a result, he in fact permitted the ambulance to be damaged by the reprehensible driving of another person, namely, Fikes. ,
Similarly, the findings as to Caton's guilt of this offense are also legally sustainable upon the aforementioned basis that both he and Fikes were engaged in a joint enterprise, and that the negligence of Fikes, which resulted in the damage to the ambulance, was, therefore, attributable to Caton. Under either theory the evidence was legally sufficient, as to Caton, to sustain the findings of guilty of Charge I and of the Specification thereunder.
It was properly established by. the evidence that the amount of the damage to the vehicle was about LICK), a sum substantially in excess of that alleged.
8.	The offense of wrongfully and without lawful permission or ^authority, taking and using the ambulance is an offense similar to
larceny, and the same punishment may be imposed therefor, (par,7, Military Justice Bulletin, J.A.G.O., 6 May 1942). As the value of the vehicle was in excess of &50, each accused could have been sentenced to confinement at'hard labor for five years, upon being found guilty of the commission of this offense alone. The sentence as to each accused is legal.
9.	Lieutenant Armstrong, 254-th Troop Carrying Company, Royal Amy Service Corps, a witness for the prosecution, testified, that he took
a statement from Driver W. F. Platt, a passenger in the British vehicle.
Platt, at the time of the trial was overseas at an unknown station.
393
(336)
The defense stated that it had no objection to the introduction of the statement and it was admitted in evidence by the court, not for the purpose of proving the truth of the statement but "just merely as a witness may testify that such statement was made". (R.36-37; Ex."C"). Although the statement was clearly inadmissible as such, in view of the manner in which it was accepted in evidence by the court with the consent of the defense, it may be considered that the prosecution and defense in fact stipulated that Platt, if present as a witness, would testify in accordance with the admitted statement.
10.	Alien the prosecution rested its case, the defense moved for findings of not guilty on all Charges and Specifications, principally on the ground of insufficiency of proof. The court deferred action on the motion and properly directed the prosecution to recall certain witnesses, to Hscall other witnesses, and to produce certain documents (R.15). Thereupon the court adjourned. The court reconvened and after introducing further evidence, the prosecution again rested. The defense renewed its motion for a finding of not guilty, and the court, after recalling one of the witnesses for the prosecution, denied the motion (R.37-39).
The action of the court in directing the prosecution to produce the required evidence after the prosecution had rested its case was proper. (M.C.M., pars.75a, 121a, pp.58,126). Its denial of the motion by the defense was similarly justified as the evidence then before the court was sufficiently substantial in character to warrant the court's consideration when maicing its ultimate findings.
11.	An examination of the Charge Sheet with respect to Filces, shows that the case was referred to trial on 8 February 194-3 to Captain Edwin E. Miller, U.A.C., 3rd Station Hospital, trial judge advocate of the general court-martial appointed by paragraph 6, Special Orders Ho.42, Headquarters, Southern Base Section, SOS, 11 February 1943. Thus, the case was referred for trial to a court which had not then been appointed. A new court was appointed by paragraph 15, Special Orders No. 55, Headquarters, Southern Base Section, SOS, 24- February 194-3. It was provided therein that all cases "heretofore referred for trial by general court-martial appointed by paragraph 6, 5.0^42, this headquarters,
11 February 194-3, on which arraignments have/been had are referred to this court-martial for trial". The same situation exists with respect to the Charges against Caton. Also, in the first indorsement on the Caton charge sheet, the rank of the commanding officer who referred the case for trial is omitted.
In CI.l 211218, Fleming, the case was referred for trial on 23 November to a court appointed 25 November, two days later. It was held that the irregularity was not fatal as it had been previously decided that if a court to which a case had not been referred tries it, the reviewing authority may ratify the court's action in so doing and act upon the sentence. (Dig. Ops. JAG., 1912-1930, Supp. VII, sec.1318).

Accordingly, the irregularities herein mentioned are immaterial*
\ •
12.	In addition to the other comments of the staff judge advocate upon the defects contained in the record of trial, it is noted that the monetary amount of damage to the ambulance is alleged in the Specification of Charge I in lieu of the value of the vehicle itself. (Form No. 67, M.C.M., p.247). The variation from the form specification is immaterial.
The omission of the word "willfully" from the Specification of Charge III was proper:
"’Doing or omitting to do a thing knowingly and willfully, implies not only a knowledge of the thing, but a determination with a bad intent to do it or to omit doing it. The word ’willfully', *** in the ordinary sense in which it is used in statutes, means not merely ’voluntarily’, but with a bad purpose. .
*** It is frequently understood, *** as signifying an evil intent without justifiable excuse. *''***, (Potter v. United States,
155 U.S. 438, 44-6; 39 Law Ed. 214, 217).
(Underscoring supplied).
The offense alleged in the Specification of Charge III was Involuntary manslaughter. The homicide involved in an involuntary manslaughter is unintentionally caused by an accused. In view of the foregoing definitions, the omission in the Specification of the word "willfully" was proper.
13.	An examination of the papers accompanying the record of trial discloses that when the charges against Caton were investigated, he was not charged with manslaughter in violation of the 93rd Article of War. Subsequently, on 22 January 1943, the staff judge advocate, Headquarters, Services of Supply, European Theater of Operations, in his report to
the Commanding General, Services of Supply, European Theater of Operations on charges preliminary to trial, recommended that Caton. be additionally charged with the offense of manslaughter. No further investigation was made or directed, and accused Caton was tried, without objection by the defense, for this offense.
\
The additional offense alleged was indicated by the facts disclosed in the report of investigation. A new investigation would show the same state of facts revealed in the original investigation.
Such a procedure would be futile, and would not in any way affect or safeguard the rights of accused. Accordingly, the fact that Caton was tried upon the Additional Charge without a further investigation thereof, did not injuriously affect his substantial rights, and did not constitute fatal error (CM 220625 - Gentry: CM ETO 106 - Orbon). The defense

did not object to trial upon a charge and specification which were unsupported by the oath of the accuser. The trial of Caton upon the Additional Charge of manslaughter in the absence of such an affidavit did not injuriously affect his substantial rights. (CM ETO 106 - Orbon: par.31, M.C.M., p.2l).
14-. Attached to the record of trial are three recommendations for clemency, one submitted by defense counsel, one by two witnesses for accused, and one signed by all the members of the court.
15. For the reasons stated the Board of Review is of the opinion that as to each accused, the record of trial is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty of all Charges and of the Specifications thereunder, and to support the sentence. The court was legally constituted and no errors injuriously affecting the substantial rights of accused were committed at the trial.
