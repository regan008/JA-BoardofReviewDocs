1.	The record of trial in the case of the soldiers named above has been examined in the Branch Office of The Judge Advocate General with the European Theater of Operations and there found legally sufficient to support the findings and sentence as to Private John J.

Specification 2i In that Private John J. O'Connell, v 46th Depot Supply Squadron, 46th Air Depot Group, did, in conjunction with Private (then Corporal)
• James (HHI) Haza, 46th Depot Supply Squadron,

wrongfully and unlawfully destroy a portion of .... a building furnished for and used by the United States, value about 440*00*	'
Each accused pleaded guilty to Specification 1, Charge II, and not guilty to all other oharges and specifications. Evidence of one previous conviction of accused Haza for absence without leave, was introduced. Each accused was found guilty of the Specification, Charge I except the words "with Intent to do them bodily harm", not guilty of Charge I but guilty of violation of the 96th Article of Tar, not guilty of Specification 2,
Charge II and guilty of Specification 1, Charge II and of Charge II. Each was sentenced to be confined-at hard labor at such place as the reviewing authority may direct, for a period of six months, and to forfeit 424*00 per month for a like period. The reviewing, authority approved the sentences, ordered their execution and designated the 2912th Disciplinary Training Center, APO 508, United States Amy as the plac? of confinement for each.	.
The result of the trial was promulgated in General Court-Martial Order To. 36, Headquarters, VIII Air Foroe Service Command, AAF-586, APO 633, dated 14 October 1943.
3.	The three specifications of the two charges against the accused herein are each similarly phrased in the language of the specification involved in CM ETO 882, Blond! and White, recently decided by the Board of Review. In the above cited case the Board found that White, charged "in conjunction with" Biondl, had not been actually charged with committing any offense and that the findings and sentence as to White were therefore not legally sufficient. James (NMI) Haza was likewise before the court upon charges and specifications which failed to allege that he had committed any crime and upon the authority quoted above, the Board of Review is of the opinion that the record of trial herein is legally insufficient to support the findings and sentence as to him.
CONFIDENTIAL

4.	The findings and sentence of the court as to accused James J. O'Connell were found legally sufficient when examined In the Branch Office of The Judge Advocate General with the European Theater of Operations and are therefore not before the Board of Review for consideration.
5.	The accused James (NUl) Haia is 20 years 8 months of age. He enlisted 24 April 1942 for the duration of the war plus six months* He had no prior service.
6.	The court was legally constituted but as to accused James Hasa was without jurisdiction of either the person or the offense.

1.	Herewith transmitted for your action under Article of War 50£ as amended by the act of 20 August 1937 (50 Stat. 724; 10 U.S.C., 1522) and as further amended by Public Law 693, 77th Congress, 1 August 1942. is the record of trial in the case of Private JOHN J. O'CONNELL (32297460; and Private JAMES (NMl) HAZA (13060930), both of 46th Depot Supply Squadron,
46th Air Depot Group.
The opinion of the Board of Review in the instant case is based upon its approved holding in CM ETO 882, Blondl and White. A copy of said holding is inclosed for your information.
2.	I concur in the opinion of the Board of Review that the record of trial is legally Insufficient to support the findings and sentence as to accused Haza. He was before the court upon charges and specifications which failed to allege that he had committed any offense and in legal effect he was not tried or placed in jeopardy. I recommend that the findings and sentence herein as to Private James (NMl) Haza be vacated and that all rights, privileges and property of which he may have been deprived by reason of such findings and sentence so vacated, be restored.
•	...	v
3* The evidence is convincing that Haza is equally guilty with O'Connell, in fact he pleaded guilty to one specification. , No legal reason, in my opinion, exists against .properly charging and trying him for the offenses committed, which might well be before a special court-martial since dishonorable discharge was not adjudged in the present trial.
4« Inclosed is a form of action designed to carry into effect the recommendation hereinbefore made. Also draft GCMO for use in promulgating the proposed action. Please return the record of trial with required copies of GCMO-____
Brigadier General, United States Army, Assistant Judge Advocate General.
