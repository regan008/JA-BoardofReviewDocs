3.	The evidence for the prosecution was substantially as follows: -
On 14 July. 1943 accused’s organization was stationed at1Phyllis Court, Henley-on-Thames, England where a.guard; post was maintained at the building (R29). The Royal Air Force maintained the guard which was operated entirely under Royal Air Force regulations. Personnel for the guard was supplied by accused’s organization in proportion to the number of men in that organization compared with the number of men in the British unit (R13,34). The post was situated in a room at the interior entrance to the building, which room was adjacent to a workroom. The duty of the guard was to prevent persons from entering the workroom, to examine all passports, to cause visitors to sign the visitors' book, to escort personnel entering’ and leaving on pass and to maintain order throughout the building. The post was stationary and was primarily confined to the limits of the room at the entrance to-the building, although the guard was'permitted to go outside to inspect passports of persons driving up in a vehicle (R13). Every guard was issued a pistol and 12 rounds of ammunition (R39). Also pursuant to Royal Air Force regulations, the guards relieved'themselves during the daytime hours (R34).
On 14 July 1943 Technician Fourth ‘Grade Joseph F. Hurley, Engineer Model Makers Detachment, was on guard from 3:30 - 4*00 p.m. Accused was to be on guard from 4 ’- 5*00 p.m. At about 4:05 - 4:10 p.m. accused relieved Hurley on the post who turned over a pistol, pistol holster, belt, and an ammunition pouch containing about 12 cartridges. Accused, appeared to be "sane and sober" at the time and there was nothing unusual about his appearance. At the trial Hurley.was shown a .38 caliber Smith & Wesson revolver, No. 802663, and testified that it "appears to be the pistol" which he gave accused. The revolver was admitted in evidence (R12-13,29j Pros.Ex. 2). About 4*30 p.m. a search of the post was made by Captain Harrison P.

Reed and First Sergeant Henry E, Cloud, both of the Engineer Model Makers Detachment, and also by Royal Air Force personnel, but the sentry was not on his post (R29-3Q,36).
On 14 July 194-3 Mr. Issy Aaronson operated a tailor shop at 11a, Greys Road, Henley-on-Thames. His three employees who worked in the shop that day were Doris Kay Staples, Mss Rebecca Woolf, 97 Greys Road and Mrs. Gertrude Li. Hurst, 28 Adwell Square, all of Henley-on-Thames (R15,18,20,23). About 12:30 p.m. accused came to the tailor shop, asked for Doris Staples, remarked "She is not here" and departed (Rl6-17,2Q-2l). He returned about 2:30 p.m. called' Mr. Aaronson into the rear yard and asked if he wanted to buy a little rain jacket for one shilling, Mr. Aaronson had seen American soldiers wear .the same type of jacket (R17,19). Doris Staples was there at the time and accused said a few words to her and gave her a "small white slip or something" which she pushed tinder a newspaper (R24). About 4*30 p.m, he a-gain returned to the outside of the shop and tapped on the window. Someone said "He is here again".
Miss Staples said "What does he want now? I had better go out and see what he wants". She went out and joined accused by the door (R17,21,24).
Miss Woolf testified that Miss Staples said "Go away, Johnny; I have work to do" (R24). Mrs. Hurst testified that apparently accused wanted Miss Staples to go somewhere, and that she heard her say "No; you know I do not come out in these clothes" (R25). Mr. Aaronson shouted to the girl,
"Come on; hurry up; get on with your work" (R17), whereupon M£ss Staples said to accused "I am going in; after all, he pays me^money" (R25).,
Miss Staples re-entered the shop and tried to close the door. Accused, however, had his foot in the door and followed her into the shop. His hand was concealed under his tunic, and as he entered he pulled out a revolver which was on a leather strap around his neck. ‘Miss Staples turned around and walked backwards towards Mrs. Hurst. He pointed the weapon at Miss Staples and fired three shots at the girl who, at the second or third shot, fell down near Mrs. Hurst in a sitting position "with her . leg up". Mrw. Hurst, seeing that the. girl was alive and believing that . . she had fainted, said to her "I will get you some water". Miss Staples replied "Oh". Mrs. Hurst left the room. Kiss Woolf testified that accused then fired two more -shots at the girl who said "Oh". Two shots were heard by Mrs. Hurst while she. was outside, filling a bucket with water. Miss Woolf then arose from her work and went around the side, of the table, whereupon accused "twisted the revolver round" and said "Not you, Betty"* * He then put the revolver under his neck, shot himself, and fell down just across from where Miss Woolf was standing. She jumped over his feet, rah outside and shouted for help. When Mrs. Hurst returned with a bucket of water accused was lying on his stomach facing the doorway with the revolver in his hand. She returned to the rear yard and looked for a way to escape over the fence (R17-27).
About 4*30 p.m. Mrs. Ivy Trendall, 7 Friday Street, Henley, a waitress in a cafe adjoining the tailor shop, was returning to the .cafe from across the street. She heard Miss Staples tell accused "No; I am not going to-night", and saw her dash into the tailor shop. Accused

(40)
followed her immediately, drawing a revolver from beneath his tunic. She then heard three or four shots, and upon looking' into the shop saw Miss Staples lying on the floor at the rear door of the shop "*** with her head to the back door and_hen feet towards the front door", and John Waters was also lying on the/floor with his feet towards the door of the tailor's shop (R27-29).
About 4*45 p.m. Inspector Henry Morris, stationed at Henley-on-Thames, was summoned to the tailor shop .and found a grpup of people standing before the entrance, one of whom shouted "Look out; he has got a gun", (IHO). Captain Harrison P. Reed and.First Sergeant Henry E. Cloud arrived at the scene about 4s45 - 4*50 p.m. (R30,36). . When Cloud looked through, the door of thd'tailor shop he.saw accused right inside the front door,
"half lying and half sitting", propped up on the floor and pointing a gun out of the front door (R36). Captain Reed or Cloud called out "Are you all right, Johnny? Throw your gun out". The gun was not thrown out (R40).
A tear gas bomb was then thrown into the front entrance of the tailor shop. Someone shouted "He has just moved". Two shots were then fired from within the tailor shop., One hit the wall on the opposite side of the road and ricochettedback into the roadway; the other entered a window opposite (R30,36-37,40). . Someone said that accused had gone out‘into the area behind the shop, and both Captain Reed and Cloud went through an adjoining , fish shop and. into the adjoining rear yard. They called accused and.asked him to throw out his gun. He replied "O.K., Henry". Captain Reed climbed the fence which was between the two areas, looked in the shop, and.saw a girl lying on the floor but did not see accused. He then looked in a brick-inclosed toilet and found accused sitting on the seat, leaning back against the wall. The.lower part of his jaw was covered with blood and he was obviously in-great pain. After Cloud climbed the fence they took from accused a .38 caliber Smith & Wesson pistol which was hanging from a lanyard around his neck and laid him out on the brick courtyard (R30r31» 37,40-41). Captain Reed noticed an odor of alcohol on his breath (R34). Cloud found two spent cartridges in the pistol but no live ammunition (R31, 37,39).- An empty pouch was attached to an R.A.F. web belt which accused was wearing around his waist (R31,38). Both Captain Reed and Cloud iden- ' tified Pros.Ex.2 as similar in appearance to the revolver which they had taken from accused's possession (R31,37). The pistol was of a type not . normally used by the United States Army but was of the type used on the guard post (R39).	• Inspector Morris,.Captain Reed and Cloud entered’the
tailor shop and found Miss Staples lying on the floor, dead (R37,4J-)»_	-	.
Before accused- was removed to the. hospital he was given the usual "English police caution" and- replied "I don't want to say anything" (R4l)• Curing the time.he was in the tailor shop accused was scheduled for guard duty (R3l) at the post which was one-third of a mile away (R35).
It was stipulated by the prosecution, accused end defense counsel that if Dr. A.E.M. Hartley,- "North Lea", Northfield End, Henley-on-Thames, was present he would testify that at 6:30 p.m. 14 July 1943 he conducted a post-mortem on the body of Doris. May Staples. He found on external examination five bullet wounds in the following positions:
- 4 -
(a)
" (l) At the top '"P the sternum in midline anteriorly:
(2)	2i inches Ix-^ow the first and slightly to the
left of midline: '	>
(3)	1^ inches below the left armpit in the mid-auxiliary line:
(4)	In front of the patella of the right knee:
(5)	At the back of the right calf 6 inches below the"bend of the knee.
All these wounds could have been caused by bullets either entering or leaving the body.
There was no sign of powder staining or singeing.
On internal examination a bullet was found which had entered at punctured wound Ho. 1 (above), and ' had penetrated the sternum- in a direction slightly upwards and to the left; it had severed the subclavian artery and the apex of the left lung; it had smashed the insertion of the first left rib and had come to rest to the left-hand side of,the Seventh'cervical verterbra. The left pleural cavity was filled with blood.	'	-
No other bullet was found, and I concluded that’ a bullet had entered punctured wound No. 2 and left at wound No. 3 without penetrating the bony thorax.
Similarly I concluded that a bullet had entered the right calf and had left the body in front of the right knee.
In my opinion, death was caused by the bullet which was recovered and which caused bullet wound No. 1.
Death must have been very rapid in one to two minutes.
The external examination of the body disclosed that the deceased had her monthly periods at the time of her death". (R41-42).
On 15 July Staff Sergeant Edmund P. Crovo, CUD Detachment, APO 647 went to the 2nd General Hospital and received permission from Majors Rogers and Scarff to take a statement .from accused. He saw accused who started to give a statement' but fell asleep after 20 seconds. Crovo left' the room and told a major what had occurred. The officer replied *!The man is perfectly all right; wake him up. Do not shake him; just nudge him and wake him up". ' Crovo left, however, and returned on each of three following days but accused was sleeping. On 19 July he was awake, and in very good spirits (RAS-4-9). After again securing permission (R46), Crovo identified himself to accused and showed him a typewritten summary of his rights under Article of War 24 which accused read and stated that he understood his rights. He then said "Everyone knows; I may as well tell you" (R44-45).
’He signed the summary of his rights tinder Article of War 24 and then gave a voluntary statement, which was written down by Crovo, and which was partly in response to Crovo*s questioning and partly the result of accused's own
narrative. The statement was read and signed by accused who remarked at the time that his "eye sight* was strained or he was tired or something like that" (R44-46',48). : The statement- was taken'in-the-presence of Captain • William.* Boyden, a military police officer, who was himself, a patient in the hospital (R48). At the:trial, 'Crovo identified the statement (R45) which'was admitted in evidence (R47; Pros.Ex.3).	The defense stated that
no legal objection was raised as to-the competency of the statement but that-its credibility; would later be questioned (R47). The statement was as. fdllows:

.	STATEMENT:
I	'am a patient at the 2nd General Hospital. I am 36 years old. I met Doris last February.- I saw . her nearly every day. I used to go to see her at the dress shop where- she worked. I used to take her to movies and to pubs.
On last Tuesday I was with Doris and we had an argument. "We argued because she was stepping out* and it made a god dam fool of me. Henley is a small town and everyone knows the others business.
I	didn't like her stepping out.
On last Wednesday‘the 14th of July I went down to see Doris at her work early in the morning.-She wa3 not in so I went back to camp. I messed around camp for a while and I was burned up at Doris. I went on guard duty and left my post and rode a bicycle up to where she works. I gave her a picture of herself that she had given me'some time before.
We talked for a while and then she went in the . store. I was standing just inside the store and I * pulled the cannon and shot her. I don't know where or how many times. She fell down and then I shot myself. I don't remember what the hell, went on afterwards.-I would only be guessing if I told you.
She was going with a fellow who is now in Africa. He was a married man and didn't get along with his wife but got along with her. I thinkshe was in love with him. I shot her because I don't like any pushing around. She used me to get something for herself.- I used to give her a lot of :

little gifts. She used tell me she had to go home early and the boys would see her later in the evening with another guy. That burned me up, I had never thought of shooting her,
I had intercourse with her on numerous occasions, One time she .told me she was pregnant and I gave her money to straighten it out. I used to think she was having intercourse with other guys and when I thought of it I got burned up, I was afraid she would turn me down in favor of the others. If she went out with others and was a lady about it and told me I wouldn't have minded but I don't like this lying stuff.

Mr. Aaronson had known accused'for about six months. He had come to his shop about every day to see I-iiss Staples and on occasions had taken her out during the lunch period (Rl6,18). Asked by defense counsel if he had noticed an odor of alcohol or liquor on "accused's breath at any of the times he visited the shop on the day of the shooting, he replied in the affirmative (R19). Miss Woolf had seen accused and the girl together "a few times a week" during the four to six months she had known him. Kiss Staples was about 37 years of age (B20,22).
On cross-examination by the defense, Mrs. Hurst testified that a short time prior to the incident she heard Mss Staples tell accused that she had heard that 2000 more "Yanks" were coming to Henley and that she would not want him. Accused replied "We will see". She further testified on cross-examination that Kiss Staples had remarked that she felt that she always had accused to wait on her and to be there when she wanted him, and that if she "played him up enough" he. would commit suicide over her.
On the day of the shooting, the girl had been rather rude to accused and Mrs. Hurst had said to her "you will make Johnny very sore if you keep on like that". The victim replied "Yes, *** it would be awful to go home and find his body on my step, and if it was there I would just say, 'Clear away the mess'". Questioned by defense counsel concerning the victim's reputation in the community, Mrs. Hurst testified "She had a pretty famous name **# She was fond of the opposite sex *** At the time no one had a good word for Doris, but everyone spoke well of Johnny" (R26).

Captain Reed further testified that the work performed by the . members of accused's unit required men with a skilled'artistic.background in some instances and also men skilled in the.use of hand and machine tools. Because of the absence of a T/0 it -was impossible for any member of the unit to secure a promotion. Those with noncommissioned officers'1 ratings had 'secured them prior to departure from the United States. ' Accused had been overseas for over a year, was a qualified technician and was engaged.in technical work. The men complained a grqat deal because they were*on British rations and "were "more or less forced” to supplement the ration by purchasing food in the town. Accused purchased many such meals when off duty. About .11 or .12 July he interviewed Captain'Reed about a notice from the Office of Dependency,Benefits concerning an approved application for a Class F allotment filed by his wife.-He was "quite agitated” because he had not seen his wife for about 12-13 years, and $22 a month was to be deducted from bis pay. He seemed disturbed because he would have less money to spend and stated that he would be forced to cancel insurance for his sister's benefit. • The following day he interviewed, the captain relative to a notice on the board concerning the possibility of a discharge for soldiers 38 years or more of age who wished to join the merchant marine.' He wan within two months of that age and "seemed to' want to do that”.. Captain Reed was of the opinion that he "seemed to be giving a lot of thought” to all the foregoing circumstances which were more or less weighing on his mind. He got along very well with the other men, was very well liked, was never obnoxious, or intoxicated while on duty. He was a very good technician. About noon, 1A July accused approached Captain Reed, said he was out of funds and asked if he could "help him out *** until such time aghe was paid **■*". so that he could purchase several meals in town. Th^captain loaned him one pound (R32-35).	.	.'	•	i	.	.	.
First Sergeant Cloud was also of the opinion that accused was upset about the allotment, the inability.to secure a promotion because of the lack of a table of organization, and the food. In his opinion accused was a good soldier, competent in his work, and had never caused any trouble (R38).	.
Captain Joy L. Hoffman, 36th;,Station Hospital, APO 64-9, chief of the neuro-psychiatric service, had accused under his direct observation from 4-16 September and from 20 October "until Saturday”. He was one of a board of three officers. who met and examined accused on 27 October 1943J he identified the board's report which was admitted in evidence (R4-5j Pros.Ex.l). The report of the board shows that it found accused to be sane and responsible for his actions at the time cf the bpard's examination, and on 14 July 1943 (R5; Pros.Ex.l). Captain Hoffman further testified that the bullet passed through accused's sub-mental region (the chin), shattered the mandicular symphysis, passed through the flopr of the mouth, tongue and hard palate and lodged in the left fpontal region of the brain. Subsequently, it migrated'through to the left occipital region (the back of the brain). There had.been one operation on the frontal part of the
U5)
skull immediately alter the injury had occurred, hut the bullet was not ' removed. On 23 September another operation was performed on the rear of the skull and the bullet was removed.from the left occipital region (R5-7). Accused was suffering from blindness in half of his eye (R6-7) which condition in all probability did not exist prior to the injury aid was caused by the bullet lodging in the region of the optic nerve (R9-10). He had experienced one convulsion in the hospital and it might be expected that he would suffer subsequent convulsions as the scar tissue formed in the. brain pulled the normal tissue about it. An apparent present inability of accused to recall events occurring "some little time" prior to his injury might-be explained by a "retrograde amnesia" a condition caused by the injury itself and manifested during the period of recovery. The presence of this condition would not mean that accused had experienced any lapse of memory before he was injured. In the opinion of Captain Hoffman accused "honestly does not remember" (R8-9). The brain injury also explained his failure "to react with a3 much agitation, worry and concern as the-average man would" because of what he had done (R3). "It is possible that there may be intellectual deterioration a3 time goes on in that his intelligence suffers; that is, his ability to do computations, his ability to remember things, his ability to use the intelligence with which he was born may be impaired; in other words, if he were graded, for instance, with a 14-years old intelligence, over a course of years he might- eventually come to the stage where his intelligence could only be rated as that of a 12-year-old" (Rll). '
•' 4.. For the defense, Mrs. Trendall was recalled as a witness and testified that she had known Miss Staples for 15 months and that her general reputation in Henley, particularly with reference to her relations with men was not very good. She had very frequently heard it discussed by Henley people that the girl "*** spent week-ends with Air Force fellows" (R50). Mr. Aaronson," also recalled as a witness by the defense, testified that he had known the victim for about two and one half years and that as far as he knew she "*** did not have such a great name in the town" (R5l). Technician Fifth Grade Robert L. Burge of accused's organization also testified that the girl's reputation in Henley was "not very favorable" (R56-57).	•
Technician Fifth Grade Thomas P. Mimms, Engineer Model Makers Detachment, had known accused for about a year and had talked with him very frequently. The two men "had a great deal in common" and were close friends.' In Mimms' opinion accused was upset because of the uncertainty of his relationship with Mss Staples'. He was also disturbed because of having to make the unexpected Class F allotment. He was having financial difficulties, and although he always promptly repaid his debts he was constantly behind, Mimms was also of the opinion that accused was not too happy in his organization and environment, felt that he had ceased to be a' part of the United States Army and was being attached to the larger "R.A.F" group. The living conditions, the use of British rations which were inferior in quality and quantity "to our own", and the lack of a T/O were irritating factors to a person of accused's character. All of these
- 9 -
(46)
things affected him visibly and he was considerably depressed mentally#
This depression wa3 "decidedly more marked at the crisis". His work in the organization was important in nature and he was performing it very well. He behaved normally in the local pubs, wa3 friendly with the people and did not drink excessively "to any marked degree" (R52-54).
Technician Fourth Grade Leonard A. Abrahams, Engineer Model Makers Detachment, testified that accused "went out more often than not with the same girl" whose first name was Doris.' He was very much incensed because his wife*, from whom he had been separated for so long, had requested an allotment from h*is pay, and he could do nothing at all about it. In Abrahams’ opinion the work accused had been doing did not require the full use of his skill. He shared the dissatisfaction of most of the men in the unit with regard to the quality of the food and the lack of a T/0, but seemed particularly angry with respect to his own personal affairs and complained about them "a good bit" (R55-56)'.
Accused, after being warned of his rights, testified that he was 38 years of age and in civilian life had been a model maker in terracotta and orhamental plaster, He had been overseas since 3 or A October 1942 (R58). He married in 1925, separated from his" wife in 1928 because of family troubles but was not'divorced (R59,65). He met Miss Staples during the latter part of January 194-3 (R59) and began to go with her regularly about the end of February (R62). He had intercourse with her from about the early part of March "to the end" (R62), the last occasion being about 5-7 days prior to 14 July (R63). He saw her about twice daily (R59), and on one occasion had given her five pounds because she told him that she was pregnant (R62). They had quarrels regularly, "but they did not amount to anything.. There was no heat in them". Some of the quarrels were caused by lies which she had told but "*** they would patch up eventually. One day , she would be mad at me and the next day I would be mad at her, but the majority of times we were all right, going here and going there". "There was no argument you would shoot someone for — nothing like that" (R60,62). About 4-7 days prior to 14 July, she was "mad" and had mentioned to accused something about going with other American soldiers who might come to Henley.
"I knew.she was kidding because I knew there were no soldiers coming there" (R63). They had a. "little argument" on 13 July which "was forgotten" (R60). Accused had practically all of his meals away from camp when he was not working.because "Everything was fried bread and brussel sprouts, and it just wrecked my stomach1! (R59). Shortly before 14 July he had received the , notice concerning an allotment to his wife from whom he had been separated about 13 years, in the amount of five pounds and ten shillings per month.
He already Had insurance in the amount of $5000 and had raised it to $10000 but "it had not been taken out yet" (R59-60), After "things seemed to tumble down, - like the allotment and a few things", accused felt he did not have.very much to' live for (R65).	.
With referenee- to events on 14 July, accused remembered nothing” except borrowing the pound from the capktain (R60,62,66). He did not recall going.on guard duty (R6I-62), being at the tailor shop or seeing Miss Staples (R6l) whom he did not at any time intend to kill (R62). He
- 10
(47)
did not remember going to town (R66), trying to sell a field jacket to Mr. Aaronson (R64) or seeing Miss Woolf (R64,66). He could not explain his statement in Pros.Ex.3 that he had gone to see Hiss Staples at work on 14- July, that she was net in, and that he returned to camp (R66).
After borrowing the pound he remembered nothing until he was in bed in the hospital with a bandaged head. He did not know how he received the injury. He could not think what had caused his lapse of memory and had never experienced one previously (R63). He learned that Miss Staples was dead when they informed him of this fact at the hospital (R65)• Re did not know whether he had anything to drink on 14 July (R64-65). The men worked from 8:00 a.m. to 4*00 p.m. and from 4*00 p.m. to 12:00 m.
If he went on guard at 4*00 he would have been on the night shift (R65), and would not have had any previous duties during the day (R66-67).
Accused further testified that he did not remember being questioned by Crovo, giving him a signed statement or reading the statement, although the handwriting on the bottom of a page of the document was similar to his own. He could not read even if he wished to do so as "ny head is good and sore, and I have had a continuous headache since it happened" (R6l-62,66). He was able to read a little at the time of the triad but would become dizzy (R63). He did recall having seen Crovo in the hospital when he had arrived to question another prisoner (R61-62).
5.	Recalled as a witness by the court, Corporal Hurley testified that when he was relieved as guard by accused the latter said that he was sorry to be late, whereupon Hurley replied "It is perfectly all right, Waters". He handed the gun to accused who was putting on the belt as Hurley departed. Accused appeared "very normal". He wore a field jacket and was neatly attired. The guard on the post was allowed to walk within the room and "around into the opening of the door", the post being the entrance to the building in which the work was carried on (R69-70).
Also recalled as a witness by the court, Crovo testified that when he took the statement from accused the latter appeared to be perfectly oriented as to the happenings of 14 July and was able to give a clear-cut picture of events leading up to the shooting. He told Crovo that he would "only be guessing" if he told him what occurred after the shots were fired. It took "the best part of an hour" to obtain the statement (R70-71).
6.	Murder is legally defined as follows:
"Murder is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought. 'Unlawful’ means, without legal justification or excuse.***" (MCM., 1928, see.148a, p.162).

U8)	•
■ Malice does not necessarily mean hatred or personal ill-will toward the person killed, nor an actual intent, to take, his . life, or even to take anyone's life. The use of the word 'aforethought', does.not mean that .the malice must exist for any 1 : particular time before the commission of the act, or that the intention to kill must have previously existed. It is sufficient if it exist at the time the act is committed.
~(Clark). Malice aforethought may exist when the act is unpremeditated. It may mean any one or more of the following states of mind preceding or coexisting with the act or
•	omission by which death is caused: An lnten-
•	tion to cause the death of. or grievious
bodily harm to. anv person *** (except when ■ • - ■ death is inflicted in the heat of a sudden ‘ passion, caused by adequate provocation); . knowledge that the act which causes death will probably cause the death of. or grievous ' bodily harm to. any person. **** although such knowledge is accompanied by indifference whether death or grevious bodily harm is caused or not or by a wish that it may not .■ be caused: **♦". (Ibid.. pp.163-164)
(Underscoring supplied).
The evidence, including accused's own testimony shows that accused had been a steady companion of Miss Staples for several months, that they frequently had intercourse and often quarreled. At about As30 p.m. on 14 July, when accused appeared for the third time at the shop and tapped on the outside of the window. Miss Staples went to the door and talked with him. The evidence indicates that she either refused to go out with him at that time or later during the evening, and told him to go away as she had "work to do". As she re-entered the shop she attempted to close the door. However, he had his foot in the door, and followed her into the shop with his hand concealed beneath his tunic. He pulled out a revolver, pointed, the weapon at Miss Staples and fired three times. After the girl fell, to the floor he fired two more shots in her direction. Miss Staples and accused had had an argument the day before the shooting. In his statement to Crovo, he admitted several times that he was "burned up* with her. ; She "was stepping out and it made a god dam fool of me". She would tell him that she had to. go home early but would be seen later in the evening in the company of another man. He thought that she was having intercourse with other men and was afraid that she would turn him down in favor of the others. • He also believed she loved mother man who was married. "I.shot her because I don't like any pushing around". The facts thus disclosed formed a ka substantial basis for the court's findings that accused was guilty of murder. His actions revealed a cold, deliberate purpose in the absence of adequate provocation either to kill Miss Staples or to inflict upon her grievous bodily harm, "some excessive' bodily injury which may naturally result in death" (Winthrop's Military

Law & Precedents, 2nd Ed., Reprint, p.673). The evidence is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty.of Charge I and-of its Specification.	•	.	•
7.	With reference to Charge II and Specification (leaving post as sentinel before being regularly relieved in violation of Article of War 86), the evidence shows that the guard system at the building was maintained by the Royal Air Force and operated under R.A.F. regulations. Accused was scheduled for guard duty from A*00 - 5s00 p.m. on the date alleged, and about A*05 - A*10 p.m. he relieved Hurley from whom he received his equipment and assumed his duties. About AO0_p.m. a search of the post was made and accused was not found. About A*30 p.m. he appeared at the tailor shop about one-third of a mile away from his post, and was on the tailor shop premises for the balance of the hour during which he was supposed to be performing his duty as a guard.
Although the manner in which accused assumed guard duty was somewhat informal and not in accordance with the usual United States Army practice, nevertheless the evidence shows that it entirely conformed with the British regulations by virtue of which the guard system for that post was admittedly maintained and operated. He violated his duty by leaving his post before he was regularly relieved.
"The fact that the sentinel-was not posted in the regular way'is not‘a defense". 1 (MOB., 1928, par. 146, p.160).
"A sentinel is on post within the meaning of this article not only-when he is walk- : ing a duly designated sentinel’s post, as is ordinarily the case in garrison, but also, for example, when he may be stationed *** on post to’ maintain internal discipline, or to guard stores ***" (Ibid).
The evidence is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty of Charge II and of the Specification-thereunder.	1
8.	It is alleged that accused did "*** willfully maim himself in the head by shooting himself with a pistol, thereby unfitting himself for the full performance of military service" in violation of Article of War 96 (Charge III and its Specification) (Underscoring supplied).• The evidence shows that after shooting the girl accused shot himself. The bullet passed through his chin, the floor of his mouth, tongue, and hard palate, and lodged in the left frontal region of the brain. Later it migrated through the left occipital region in the rear of the brain, and was surgically removed. As a result, at the time of trial, accused was suffering from blindness in half of his eye. He had experienced one convulsion and would, in all probability experience others during the healing process. In the opinion of Captain Hoffman it was possible that
- 13 -
(50)
accused would suffer intellectual deterioration with the passage of time, n*** his ability to do computations, his ability to remember things, his ability'to use the intelligence with which he was born may be impaired **■*« .
The offense of self-maiming in violation of Article of War 96 should not be confused with that of mayhem in violation of Article of War 93. A person may be guilty, of self-mayhem (MCM., 1928, .par. 149b, p.167).
"Mayhem is a hurt of any part of a man's body whereby he is rendered less able, in fighting, either to defend himself or to annoy his adversary. (Bishop).•
Thus it is mayhem to put out a man'3 eye, to cut off his hand, or his foot or finger, or even to knock out a front tooth, as these are members which he may use in fighting; but it is otherwise if either the ear or nose is cut off or a back tooth knocked off, as these injuries merely disfigure him. (Clark). (MCM., 1928, par.149^, . p.167).
"The word 'maim* is used in the popular sense of mutilating, and not as synonymous with the technical word 'mayhem'. (Words & Phrases,
Perm.Ed., Vol.26, p.50).
"'Maim' is defined as 'To mutilate or seriously wound or disfigure; disable'" (Words &
Phrases, Perm.Ed., Vol.26, p.48).
"MAUI. At common law, to deprive a person
Ox & Li3IakJ6i' OP pcij. u sjx OliO	y	LiLS -4.0^3 ~j.
which renders him less capable of fighting;• or of defending himself; to commit mayhem
'But both in common speech and as the word is now used in statutes and in-the criminal ■ law generally, maim-signifies, to cripple or '	mutilate	in	any	way, to inflict upon a person
any injury which *** renders him *** defective in bodily vigor; to inflict any serious bodily injury." (Black's Lav/ Dictionary, 3rd Ed.,
.. p.lLJ2).
A specific intent to maim is not necessary (Wharton's Crim.Law, 12th Ed., Vol.I, sec.768, footnote 8, p.1051; Terrell v. State, 86 Term. 523). Tl19 word "willful" means:	.
- H
(51)
"done with evil intent, or with a bad motive or purpose, or with indifference to the natural consequences; unlawful; without legal justification." (Black's Law Dictionary, 3rd Ed.., p.1849).
The evidence, including the medical testimony shows beyond any doubt that accused willfully maimed himself as alleged and thereby unfitted himself for the full performance of military service. The evidence is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty of Charge III and of its Specification.
9.	Mr. Aaronson noticed an odor of alcohol or liquor on accused's breath when the latter was at his shop on 14 July, and Captain Reed testified that he noticed an odor of alcohol on his breath when he was removed from the toilet. This constituted the only evidence which indicated that accused might have been drinking. Hurley testified that when accused relieved him from guard duty at about 4'05 - 4*10 p.m. he was "sane and sober", that he appeared ."very normal" and was neatly attired.
The question of intoxication was not raised by the defense, and was not an issue in the case. Further discussion thereon is unnecessary.
10.	A board j>f/officers was convened to determine accused's sanity pursuant to the. provisions of paragraph 35c, M.C.M., 1928 and AR 420-5.
On 27 October 1943 the board found that he was sane and responsible for his actions "now" and on 14 July 1943» The report of the board was admitted in evidence (R5; Pros.Ex.l). 11
11. .The prosecution offered in evidence the report of the board of officers and the pistol and they were admitted as exhibits for the prosecution* The record do.es not indicate whether the. defense consented or objected thereto (R5,12). These irregularities did not injuriously affect the substantial rights of accused. When the prosecution offered the statement of accused in evidence the defense stated in substance that it had no objection as to the "competency" of the statement but that it would later question its "credibility" by showing that when the statement was, made, accused "did not know anything about it" (R47). Accused subsequently testified that he did not recall being questioned by Crovo, giving him a signed statement or reading the statement. Crovo testified that after he had warned accused of his rights, the latter made a voluntary statement. He told Crovo that he understood his rights, appeared to be perfectly oriented as to the happenings of 14 July and gave a clear-cut picture of events leading up to the shooting. Captain Hoffman testified
.that an apparent present inability of accused to recall events occurring "some little time" prior to his injury might be explained by "retrograde amnesia", a conditioq caused by the injury itself. The questions as to whether the statement was of a voluntary nature and whether accused was conscious of what he was doing when he made the statement, were issues of fact for the sole determination of the court, and in view of all the evidence the Board of Review sees no reason to disturb its findings.

.	12.	Attached to the record of trial is & petition for clemency
addressed to the Copnanding General, ETOUSA, dated 18,December, 1943 signed by about 35 members of accused’s organization. Also attached 1b' a letter, from Mrs. V. Hunter-Hiiskett arid Miss May. Pardoe dated 22 December 1943 and inclosing a petition'for clemency signed by approximately 302 citizens of Henley-on-Thames.' Attached’ is a memorandum signed by the Commanding General, ETOUSA wherein it is stated in substance that he has. again considered all of the circumstances appearing in the record .of trial which are. favorable to accused, viewed in the light of the foregoing petitions for clemency, and that no circumstance disclosed in the record of trial or brought to his' attention in these petitions “tends to justify'' the accused’s criminal act of murder for which he stands.properly convicted. ' The sentence,of death (heretofore confirmed) should be carried out, subject to the requisite action under Article of War 50^“.
13. The charge sheet shows that accused is 38 years.of age, that he was inducted 16; May 1942 in the Army of .the United States for the duration of the war plus six months,, and was assigned to the Engineer Model Makers Detachment,. 3 October 1942. He had no prior service'. ,	'
' 14. The court was legally constituted and had jurisdiction of the person and offends. No errors.injuriously affecting the substantial rights of accused were committed during the trial. The Board of Review is of the opinion that .the record of .trial is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty and the sentence.. The penalty'for murder is. death or life imprisonment as the court-martial may direct (AW 92) the penalty for the offense of a sentinel leaving his post before being regularly relieved in time of war is death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct (AW 86). The sentence that accused be hanged by the neck until dead is legal (CM EIO 438, Smith: CM ETO 255> Cofrfo;
CM ETO 969. Davis; MCM., 1928, par.103a, p.93).	-
