HOLDING by the BOARD OF REVIEW RITER, VAN BENSCHOTEN and SARGENT, Judge Advocates
' 1. The record of trial in the case of the soldier named above has been examined by the Board of Review.
2. Accused was tried upon the following Charge and Specification:
CHARGE:	Violation	of	the	58th Article of War.
Specification:	In that Private John C. Medeiros,
Company A., 37th Replacement Battalion,
10th Replacement Depot, Whittington Barracks,
Lichfield, Staffordshire, England, did, at Whittington Barracks, Lichfield, Staffordshire, England, on or about 19 May 1943, desert the service of the United States and did remain absent in desertion until he was apprehended at Kingsnorton, Birmingham,	>
Warwickshire, England, on or about 8 January 1944.
He pleaded not guilty to the Charge and Specification but "guilty to the 6lst. Article of War in that he was absent without leave from 19 May,
1943 to on or about 8 Janilary, 1944." He was found guilty of the Charge and Specification. Evidence was introduced of one previous conviction
- 1 -
by special court-martial, for absence without leave for 71 days in violation of Article of War 61. He was sentenced to be dishonorably discharged the service, to forfeit all pay and allowances due or to become due and to be confined at hard labor for 15 years at such place as the reviewing authority may direct. The reviewing authority approved the sentence, designated the United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania as the place of confinement and forwarded the record of trial for action pursuant to the provisions of Article of War 50^.
3.	Accused's absence without leave from Lichfield from 19 May 194-3 to 8 January 1944- is established by his plea of guilty of a violation of Article of War 61 (R7), which he reaffirmed after its meaningswas explained to him (Rll), and by other competent evidence- (R8-11; Pros.Ex.A), He was apprehended in civilian clothes at King's Norton, Birmingham on 8 January 1944 by a British detective constable in conjunction with two American Military Police officers. Upon apprehension he admitted to the constable that he was a deserter (R9).
• Absence without leave having been established, the only question presented by the record is whether it contains sufficient evidence of accused's specific intent not to return to the military service of the United States. In the opinion of the Board of'Review, such, specific intent is clearly established by evidence exclusive of accused's admission that he was "a deserter" (CM ECO 656, Tavlor: CM ETO 740, Lane; CM ET0 800, Ungardi CM ETO 823, Poteet; CM ETO 875, Fazio: CM ETO 913, Pierno: CM ETO 952, Mosser: CM ETO 960, Fazio et alj CM ETO 1165, Vlttltoe: CM ETO 1259, Rusniaczvk). It is therefore unnecessary to consider the effect of such statement.
4* The charge sheet shows that accused is 24 years two months of age and was inducted at Providence, Rhode Island 22 April 1942, He had no prior service.	•	•	>
'	5, The oourt,was legally constituted and had jurisdiction of the
person and offense. No errors injuriously affecting-the substantial rights of accused were committed during the trial. The Board of Review is of the opinion that the record of trial-is.legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty and the sentence. The punishment for desertion committed in time of war is death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct (AW 58). The designation of the United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania as the place, of confinement is authorized
(AW 42; ID, Circular #291^ sec.V, j£ and &, 10 November 1943).
