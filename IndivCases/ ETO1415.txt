He pleaded guilty to Charge IH and its Specification and.not guilty to Charges I and II and their respective specifications and was found guilty of all-charges and specifications. Nb evidence of previous convictions , was introduced. He was sentenced to be dishonorably discharged the ser- • vice, to forfeit all pay and allowances due or to become due and to be confined at hard labor at such place as the reviewing authority may direct for ten years. The reviewing authority approved the sentence, designated the United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, as the place of confinement and forwarded the record of trial for action pursuant to the provisions of Article of War 50i»	*
3. Adequate substantial proof of the offenses alleged in the specifications of Charges I and II was adduced to support the findings and sentence (CM ETD 885, Van Horn* CM ETO I327, Urie (0)). Although the accused was proven to have been in possession of only a portion of the stolen property (R7,10), such evidence coupled with proof that he had access to all of•it (R9) at a time not unreasonably remote under the circumstances, is sufficient to support the inference that he stole the whole (CM ETO 952, Mossert CMJ157982, Acosta* CM 192031, Allen* Underhill's Crim. Ev*, 4th Ed., sec.514, p.10401 1 Wharton's Crim. Ev., 11th Ed.,•sec»191, p.198).
4» The Review of the Staff Judge Advocate contains a discussion of numerous irregularities in the proceedings none of which injuriously affects the substantial rights of the accused. Further comment here is unnecessary.

The charge sheet shows accused to be 35 years four months of agej he served with Company A, 113th Engineers from 11 April 1941 to 3 November 1941 and was recalled to active service from Enlisted Reserve Corps and Inducted in Army of the United States 19 January 1942 for duration o£ war and six months.

6.	The court was legally constituted and had jurisdiction of the person and offenses* No errors injuriously affecting the substantial rights of accused were committed during the trial* The Board of Review is of the opinion that the record of trial is legally sufficient to % support the findings of guilty and the sentence. Confinement in a penitentiary is authorized for the offense of larceny of more than $50,00 (AW 42j Sec*287 Federal Criminal Code; 35 Stat', 1144} 18 U.'S.C., 466).
The designation of the United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, as the place of confinement is authorized (WD, Circular #291, Sec.V, 3a and b, 10 November 1943)*
