Specification 3* In that *■*•*■*•*■***, having been duly restricted to the limits of AAF Station 569, APO 635, did, on or about 12 December, 1943, break said restriction by going to Preston, Lancashire, England.
CHARGE II:	Violation	of	the	83rd Article of War.
Specifications In that- *■•****♦**, did, at Preston, Lancashire, England, on or about 12 December, 1943, through neglect suffer a 4x4^" ton truck of a value of more than -fifty dollars -($50.00), military property belonging to the United States, to be damaged by collision with another vehicle. -
ADDITIONAL CHARGE: Violation of the 96th Article of War.
Specification: In that	****•*•*•**, did,"
at Bamber Bridge, Preston, Lancashire, England, on or about 10 December, 1943, wrongfully and unlawfully have carnal knowledge of a female person, to-wit: Margery Thompson, who was then under the age of 16 years, and above the age of 13 years.
He. pleaded not guilty to and was found guilty of all charges and specifications. Evidence of two previous convictions was introduced, one by special court-martial for willful disobedience of and threatening to strike a noncommissioned officer in violation of Article of War 65 and one by summary court for selling his valid pass to another enlisted man in violation of Article of ’War 96. He was sentenced to be dishonorably discharged the service, to forfeit nil pay and allowances due or to become due’and to be confined at hard labor for ten years at sucly^^he reviewing authority may direct. The reviewing authority approved the sentence, designated Eastern Branch, United States Disciplinary Barracks, Beekman, New York as the place of confinement and forwarded the record of trial for action pursuant to the provisions of Article of War 50£.
3.	Accused's guilt of wrongfully taking and using a Government vehicle without authority (Specification 1, Charge I), driving it upon a public highway while intoxicated (Specification 2, Charge I), and suffering it to be damaged through neglect (Charge II) is established beyond reasonable doubt. The allegation in Specification 2, Charge I, that accused did "while under the influence of alcohol, recklessly operate a motor vehicle upon the public highway in such a manner as to cause an accident" states an offense in violation of Article of War 96. It is not necessary that the words used in the specification state specifically that the alleged act was "wrongful" or "unlawful" if they imply such character (CM 113535 (1918);
CM 130811 (1919) (Dig.Ops.JAG., 1912-40, sec.451(8), p.312); and see CM 226512 (1943), (Bui,JAG., Vol.II, No.l, Jan.1943, sec.454(37a), p.17)).
The act of driving of a Government motor vehicle under the circumstances

(249)
alleged Is inherently wrong. The omission of the words "wrongfully" and "unlawfully" was, therefore, immaterial.
4.	With reference to Specification 3, Charge I, the evidence shows that on 12 December 1943, the commanding officer of accused's company informed him that he was "restricted to the post" for one week effective immediately. The restriction was imposed upon accused as company punishment under Article of War 104 for absence without leave for 12 hours, from eight o'clock on the e vening of 11 December to eight o'clock on the morning of 12 December (R33-36). It was entered in the company punishment book (R37). . Accused broke the restriction, left the post.and became involved in the motor accident which was made the subject of Specification 2, Charge I (R38,52). The only evidence with respect to compliance with the provisions of Article of War 104 and with the regulations thereunder (Manual for Courts-Martial 1928, par.107, p.104) is that the commanding officer informed accused that "it was a court-martial offense, but that I was going to impose company punishment upon him." (R34).
The company commander in the maintenance of discipline and control of his unit possessed inherent authority to impose such restriction upon accused. It is a usual and ordinary form of punishment under the 104th Article of War and is so understood by every soldier and officer.
This case contains one element which is absent from CM ETO 1015, Branham. There the order was not only illegal because of noncompliance with the provisions of the Article- and Manual for Courts-Martial but the punishment was improper because- beyond the disciplinary power of the officer giving the order. In the instant case the punishment was clearly within the commanding officer's disciplinary power. However in both cases there was a total failure to comply with the provisions of the 104th Article of War with respect to informing accused of his sight to demand court-martial in lieu of summary punishment and of his right to appeal from the punishment imposed. The Board of Review affirms the doctrine of the Branham case. Regardless of the legality of. the punishment imposed in the instant case it concludes that the restriction imposed upon accused was the result of an order which was not a "lawful command" within the purview of the 64th Article of War.
Such conclusion does not relieve accused from culpability. The company commander attempted to exercise lawful authority over accused. The commander failed to comply with conditions contained in the statutory authority granted him by Congress. Such failure however did not confer upon accused the license deliberately and willfully to flout the commander's disciplinary control over him. His conduct in.ignoring his commander's control and authority displayed such a spirit of insubordination and defiance as to constitute a-disorder prejudicial to good order and military discipline under the 96th Article of War (Manual for Courts-Martial 1928, . par.134b, p.149; Manual for Courts-Martial 1921, par.415, p.355; Winthrop's Military Law & Precedents, Reprint, p.575 and footnote 26).

. 5. The offense of unlawful carnal knowledge of•a female tinder the age of 16 years was properly laid under the 96th Article of War (Additional 1 -Charge and Specification). This offense is denounced and made punishable for a first offense by imprisonment for not more than 15 years by Federal Criminal Code Section 279 (35.Stat. 1143; U.S.C. 4-58). Under the Federal Law the allegation that the female involved was "above the age of 13 years'} was immaterial and may be treated.as surplusage (CM ETO 895, Davis et al, par.lOa, p.36). Evidence bearing upon the extent of the female's age below 16 years and accused's knowledge or belief with respect to her age was immaterial to his guilt* The trial judge advocate's reference to the English Law was improper but non-prejudiclal (Military Justice Cir. #6, BOTJAG with ETQ, par.2, 11 Nov 1943).'
6. The charge sheet shows that accused is 20 years of age and that he was inducted at Fort George G. Meade 15 March 1943 to serve for the duration and six.months thereafter. He had no prior service.
7.	The court .was legally constituted and had jurisdiction of-the accused and offenses. No errors injuriously affecting his substantial rights were committed during the trial. The Board of Review is of the opinion that the .record of trial.is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty and the sentence. Confinement.in a United States Disciplinary Barracks is authorized (AW 42).

1.	In the case of Private CLARENCE (NMI) ENGLISH (33590563), 1947th Quartermaster Truck Company (Aviation), 1511th Quartermaster Truck Regiment Aviation (Special), attention is invited to the foregoing holding by the Board of Review that the record of trial,is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty and the sentence, which holding is hereby approved. Under the provisions of Article of War 50^, you now have authority to order execution of the sentence.
2.	The Additional Charge and Specification laid under Article of War 96 charges the offense of carnal knowledge of a female under the age of sixteen years, a crime denounced by Federal Criminal Code Section 279 (35 Stat. 1143; 18 U.S.C. 458). The reference by the Trial Judge Advocate, at page 12 of the record, to a memorandum stating that:
"if evidence of the law of England is introduced to show that 'statutory rape' is a crime in England, evidence of this statutory defense would appear to be admissible in evidence in applicable cases to show & recognized extenuating circumstance"
.was manifestly improper. The memorandum referred to (Memo No.l JA, SOS, ETO, 1 Jan 1943) is not in force(aee Index, Military Justice, 31 Jan 1944, Memo No.4 JA, 80S, ETO, 1 Feb 1944 and Military Justice Cir. #6, BOTJAG with ETO, par.2, 11 Nov 1943). The English Law covering this type of offense is entirely irrelevant and not for consideration or application by United States courts-martial (See Military Justice Cir. #6 BOTJAG with ETO, par.2, 11 Nov 1943).
3.	Prosecution's Exhibit A - certified copy of the birth certificate of Margery Thompson - is not included in the record of trial. This exhibit or a true copy thereof must be forwarded to this office for attachment to the record.
4.	The place of confinement should be changed to the Eastern Branch, United States Disciplinary Barracks, Greenhaven. New York (Cir. #210, sec. VI, par.2a, 14 September 1943 as amended by Cir* #331, seo.II, par.2, 21 December 1943)* This may be done in the published general court-martial order.
