3* No evidence was presented in explanation of the dircumstances or in mitigation of the offenses. The effect in law of the plea of guilty is that of a confession of the offenses as charged. The record shows accused was represented by counsel and understood the effect of his plea of guilty.
»***. While it was no doubt the practice former- • ly, as it is now in the majority of cases in which this plea is interposed, not to take any evidence whatever, the fact that some evidence was necessary, to a comprehension of a considerable proportion of such cases seems to have been appreciated at an early period. *«**. In a General Order ***» of 1830, it was declared **►* that* *In every case in which a prisoner pleads guilty, it is the duty of the court-martial, notwithstanding, to receive and to report in its'proceedings such'evidence as may afford a full knowledge of the circumstances; it being essential that the facts and particulars should be known to those whose duty it is to*report on the case, or who have discretion in carrying the sentence into effect•* *#**.
Later, in No.21 of the Orders of 1833, the General Commanding, in remarking that the old rule that no evidence should be received with the plea of guilty, had been abrogated by recent Orders, disapproves the action of a certain court-martial in disregarding the same and refusing to allow the Judge advocate to show, notwithstanding such plea, the facts and circumstances of the case, which - it is declared - are essential both to the reviewing officer and to the President as the pardoning power. *■***» (Winthrop'a Military Law &

Occasional statements are found in the reports of courts-martial cues similar to the following!
***** After a plea of guilty, it is not necessary for the prosecution to Mh> out a case ******
(CM 118766 (1918), Dig.Ops.JAG., 1912-1940, per*378(3), p.189.
"TJhder ordinary circumstances, a plea of guilty is sufficient, in the absence of any evidence by the prosecution to Justify a finding of guilty. **** (CM 134185 (1919), Dig.Ops.JAO.,
1912-1940, par.378(3), p.190).
Legal treatises on Practices and Procedure are brief in discussing guilty pleas!
"The effect of this plea (guilty) is a record admission of whatever is well alleged in the indictment. If the latter is insufficient, it confesses nothing; but if good, the court >	proceeds	to	sentence	******	(2	Bishop’s	Hew
Criminal Procedure, 2nd Id., par.795(2), p,620).
v	•	«	•	-	*	♦
The more recent practice of both our civil and military courts clearly inclines towards requiring some evidence to be produced in explanation of the circumstances of the commission of the offense that the court, the reviewing and the clemency authorities may each intelligently function!
. "In addition to a careful investigation into the circumstances surrounding the plea, the court ought always to hear evidence to determine the degree of punishment ***** Ho court ought to accept a judicial confession as.final until, a most.searching investigation has been made into all the conditions and surrounding circumstances** (Wharton’s Criminal Evidence,
Vol.2, par.587, pp.975-976)..
"While it is true that a plea of.guilty admits • the facts set forth in the Specification, it has always been deemed.to be the better practice for the prosecution to present a prims, facie case against accused by competent evi-'dence notwithstanding the plea* *****. (CM 236359 (1943), Bui*JAG., July 1943, see.4l6(3), p.270).

some evidence of the circumstances of the offense to be presented in the _ record, which evidence was denied to the court herein, the numerous letters and signed statements.of, the principals involved.Included among the attached papers accon$»nying the record of this .trial, rather fully detail the entire circumstances of the offenses charged, and may be considered, in this case, to supply the information essential for the use of reviewing and clemency authorities.
4.	The accused is 23 years 3 months old. He enlisted at Akron, Ohio, on 15 July 1940, with no prior service. His service period is governed by the Service Extension Act 1941.
5.	The court was legally constituted and had jurisdiction of the person and of the offenses. No errors injuriously affecting the substantial rights of accused were committed during the trial. The Board of Review is of the opinion that the record of trial is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty and the sentence.
6.	Pursuant to paragraph 5c, GO #37, ET0U5A, 9 September 1942 as amended by GO #63, ET00SA, 4 December 1942 a sentence of dishonorable discharge may be ordered executed when accused is sentenced to confinement for not less than three years. By virtue of the same orders a general prisoner say be returned to the United States to serve a sentence of three years or more. Confinement in a penitentiary is authorized for the crime of larceny of property valued in excess of $50.00 (18 U.S.C., sec.466),
As accused is under 31 years of age with.a sentence of not more than 10 years, the designation of the federal^Reformatory, Chillicothe, Ohio^as the place of confinement Is correct (War Department letter AG 253 (2-6-41)
