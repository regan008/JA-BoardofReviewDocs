U. On 29 August 1942, Battery C, 4.6th Field Artillery was stationed at Camp Hilton, Iceland. (R.59, 92, 202); On that date there were two details taken from that'battery for work on the coke pile (R.60, 92, 99, 202). Corporal Monroe and Corporal Yates were in charge of the details (R.59, 61,92, 99) In Corporal Monroe's detail were the accused, and also Privates Kenneth W. Moore, Thomas, and others (R.59, 61, 96,' 99). The Monroe detail went to work at 9.45 p.m.» that night and worked until 11.45 p.m. (R.60, 67, 96, 100). At that hour the detail quit work to eat (R.60, 67, 96) the mid-night meal in the maintenance shop (R.60, 67, 97).
The accused and Moore were present when food was served. Immediately thereafter Moore went to the coke pile (R.61, 67), and then he met accused near a cream colored house located about thirty yards from the Camp Hilton gate (R.61, 68, 202). With them were Seale, Morris, Hunt and Leffler.
The men "monkeyed" around the first mentioned house for a time, and then accused and Moore saw a light issuing, from another house located about 200 or 300 yards from the first house. The second house was Smaravellir, owned and occupied as a summer house by Georg and Gudbjorg and particularly described below, (R.61, 69 , 202). The two soldiers had heard that the latter house was one of prostitution (R.61, 69, 202), and they went over to it at about 2 a.m., 30 August 1942. They went through the gate to the window on the bed-room side of the house (R.61, 69, 203, 206, 208).
5.	Smaravellir is the name of the summer home of Georg and Gudbjorg. It is in Fifilhvammi, Iceland (R.52). The house stands a distance'back from the street line and there is a pathway from the street to the front door. On one side of the pathway is a hedge (Prosecution's Ex.F). The pathway is covered with gravel. The house consists of three rooms (R.7, 47); a bed-room, kitchen and a parlor (R.7, 47). The bed-room adjoins the parlor and the door between the two rooms consists of a curtain or drapery (R.24, 63). The kitchen also adjoins the parlor (R.46). Ingress and egress to the house, is gained through an entrance facing the street and which opens into an enclosed hall-way or entrance-way (Prosecution's Ek.H; Defense Ex.C; R.7, 47). Upon entering the hall one turns and passes through a second door-way into the parlor (R.7, 47).
These two apertures each possess doors which swing on hinges and are equipped with latches. The bed-room has a window facing south (R.50) and the parlor has a window next to the door and a window on the side (R.47).
The bed-room has a window on the side facing the street (R.47; Prosecution's Ex.H).

On the evening of 29 August 1942, Georg and Gudbjorg left their home at about 7 p.m. (R.52). Klara is a sister-in-law of Gudbjorg (R.20, 52). Klara was left in charge of the hone and with the care of the three daughters of Georg and Gudbjorg, viz; Halla, age 11, (R.38),
Anna II, age 9 (R.6) and an unnamed infant (R.6, 52). That evening Anna, age 11 (R.28), and a friend of Halla, was also present in the home (R.5, 28). Georg and Gudbjorg returned to their home at about 10 p.m. for a few minutes and then departed and did not return until approximately the hour of 3.30 a.m., 30 August 1942 (R.52. 53). The three small girls and the infant were in bed by 11 p.m. (R.23); Klara also retired about that hour (R.28, 38). The group slept in the bed-room (R.28, 38). At about 2 a.m., 30 August 1942, Klara was awakened by noise she heard outside the house (R.7, 29, 39). A light had been kept burning in the bed-room (R.7, 13). She was then dressed in a yellow night-dress (R.7, 8) but she immediately clad herself in an ecru colored shirt and pants, negligee, a brown dress and brown jersey (R.7, 8,179). She also continued to wear her night-dress (R.8, 179) and a watch on her arm (R.IO).
((The prosecution introduced the foregoing clothing in evidence as follows:	Ex.	A: Brown dress (R.27); Ex.B: Night-dress (R.27j Ex.C: Shirt
(R.27); Ex.D: Pants (R.27). The jersey or sweater had been burned prior to trial (R.179)). She heard someone, approach the front door (R.6, 25).
She first saw a main through the window .next to the door entering the hall-way (R.6, 22, 23,.25, 26) and she informed the children of such fact (R.6, 22, 24, 29). She then turned on the parlor light. The man was then standing in the door way (R.6, 23, 24, 29). Prior to the entrance of the man tfte doors had been closed and it was dark (R.IO). The man was dressed in blue and held an axe or hatchet in his hand (R.6, 23, 29) and wore a white cloth over the lower pert of his face, leaving his eyes exposed (R.18, 21, 29). He went into the bed-room and pulled Klara into the parlor (R.6, 20, 33, 39) and thrasher to the floor (R.6, 14, 18, 29), knelt over her and got on top of her (R.63, 74) and pounded her in the face with his fists (R.6, 18). He gagged her mouth with a rag (R.6, 14, 18) but she succeeded in removing the gag (R.9, 14)• He held ber hands behind her (R.6) and while on the floor he felt with his hands up her pant's leg (R.9), and tore her pants (R.9) while holding her down (R.9). She wore a wrist watch on her left arm at the time of the assault (R.IO). '.Then the man pulled Klara into the parlor and pushed her to the floor she screamed (R.24, 29, 34. 39, 41) loud enough to be heard outside of the house (R.34, 39, 41). The man after beating Klara severely picked her up in his arras and carried her outside of the house (R.6, 14, 15) onto the pathway and threw her to the ground (R.6, 15, 19). At about this time Klara was struck on the head with an axe or hatchet and was rendered unconsciousness (R.6, 11, 16). She wore artificial teeth (R.ll) which were found in a broken condition that night by Isaakson on the ground immediately outside of the exterior hall-way door (R.57, 58). Upon recovering consciousness Klara returned to the house (R.ll, 16) while Trausti was standing in the door way (R.ll, 16), The girls, Anna and Halla, immediately after the man pulled Klara from the bed-room into the parlor escaped from the house by climbing through the bed-room window (R.29, 30, 40), and went
(49)
to Trausti's house (R.30, 40, 45). Trausti was a neighbor of Georg and Gudbjorg (R.30, 44) his house being distant about 100 meters. The girls awakened Trausti and gave the alarm (R.30, 45). Upon making their exit through the bed-room window, the two girls saw an American soldier, dressed in blue pants, blue blouse and blue hat, standing in front of the house (R.31, 32, 35, 36, 40, 41, 42). Trausti immediately went to Smaravellir and found the outer door open (R.45), and the rooms lighted (R.45). There was a large pool of blood about one meter from the threshold (R.45, 49), and drops of blood on other places on the floor (R.45). No one was in the parlor, but there was a little girl and baby in the bed-room (R.45). Trausti returned to his house and consulted his wife (R.45), and then returned to Smaravellir and placed a coat on the little girl and wrapped the infant in covers and carried it in his arms (R.45). As Trausti was leaving the house with the children he saw Klara approaching the door (R.46). Klara entered the house (R.ll, 16, 46).
Her hair was unkempt; her face and hair were covered with blood; her right eye and lower lip were swollen; and there wa3 a wound and blue spot on her face (R.22, 46, 53, 57). She wore a dress (R.4&), and was barefooted (R.46). Trausti bathed her head with fresh water to remove the blood (R.46, 49)•
He then went for aid (R.46, 50) and secured the presence of two neighbors,, one of whom was Isaakson (R.58). At about 3.30 a.m., 30 August 1942, 'y Georg and Gudbjorg returned to their home (R.53). Klara was taken to the hospital by Haukar, and arrived at the accident ward at 5 a.m., 30 August 1942 (R.147). She was badly injured and was suffering from shock (R.135). There w®e definite indications of a concussion of the brain, and further examination revealed that her skull was fractured (R.135). She had three deep wounds about the middle of the head (R.136); also a wound on her nose and lower lip (R.I36), and four or five smaller wounds (R.136). There was no evidence of any unnatural condition of her vagina nor signs of dirt, blood or scratches around her reproductive organs (R.136).
6.	The watch Klara wore at the time of the assault had been purchased on 7 August 1940,by her from Sigurd, the jeweler, whose place of business was in Reykjavik, Iceland (R.80), for the price of 145 kronur (R.S0). Sigurd testified that the replacement cost of the watch on
29 August 1942, was 250 kronur (R.81). On 31 August 1942, while policing up the hut in which accused slept and lived, Sgt. Roy H. Mtchell,
Battery C, 46th Field Artillery Battalion, discovered the watch in the crack between the wall and the floor of the hut at a place in the hut where accused's cot had been located (R.104, 105). He delivered it to Acting 1st bgt. Colbert (R.105), who in turn delivered it to the Battery Commander (R.107, 108). The watch (Prosecution's Ex.E) was produced in Court and was positively identified by Klara as being the watch she wore on her arm at the time of the assault (R.10). It had a brown leather band or strap (R.10) which was broken at the time it was identified by Klara on the witness stand (R.10). Klara stated that the watch was on her arm when she was carried outside of the house and thrown on the ground by the man who assaulted her (R.10).
7.	Prosecution's Exhibit F is a hatchet (R.36). It was identified by Gudbjorg as being the property of Georg and herself which she had used about 6 p.ra. on 29 August 1942 to split wood or break coal. She left it in the back of her house (R.53, 54). The hatchet was also identified by
(50)
Anna as having been seen by her in the rear of Smaravellir (R.29). It was discovered about 7 o’clock on the morning of 30 August 1942, by Private Harold E. Arvin, 812th Military Police Company a,t a spot about 60 ft to the right from the front of the house and in the corner of the fence towards the road (R.lll, 123, 195). It was in high grass about four feet from the road (R.112, Defense Ex.C), There was what appeared to be woman’s hair along the handle and around the blade (R.112, 196), and also strands of woman's hair on the barbed wire fence a few feet from where the hatchet lay (R.196). Both the accused and Pvt. Kenneth W. Moore agree that the hatchet, or axe, was found by them in the rear of the house on the night of the commission of the crimes charged (R.62, 75, 76, 203).
8.	Prosecution's Exhibit G is the accused's field jacket (R.115)J Prosecution's Exhibit J is the accused's woollen underdrawers (R.114)J Prosecution's Exhibit K is accused's O.D. Shirt (R.115); Prosecution's Exhibit L is accused's O.D pants (R.115). They were removed by accused from his body at 9 a.m. on 31 August 1942 and delivered to Capt. Richard D. Martin, M.C., 46th Field Artillery Bn. (R.113, 114, 115). At the time of removal accused informed Captain Martin that he had been wearing those clothes, without removing them, since /the night of August 29, 1942 ^R.114, 212, 215). Captain Martin delivered Exs. G, J, K, and L. to Captain Richard C. Taylor, M.C., 208th General Hospital, Camp Helgafell, Iceland, for examination.
Prosecution's Exhibit M is accused's overalls (R.210, 238) which he wore on the night 29-30 August 1942 (R.210). They were delivered to Capt. Taylor, M.C., 208th General Hospital for examination (R.116, 248).
Prosecutor's Ex. N is Private Moore's fatigue clothes (R.121) which he wore on the night 29-30 August 1942 (R.122). They were delivered to Capt. Taylor, M.C., 208th General Hospital for examination (R.145).
A laboratory analysis (208th General Hospital) was made for the purpose of determining whether or not there was human blood on accused's clothes and the type of blood (Prosecution's Exs. G,J,K,L,M). The method used is that prescribed in an Army text book and is acceptable (R.127).
A satisfactory control was established whereby false results could be detected (R.128). It was the opinion of Capt. Taylor, who ran the tests, that there was human blood on accused's underwear (Prosecution's Ex, J) (R.130). It was of type "0" (R.128). Accused's field jacket (Prosecution's Ex. G) and accused's O.D. pants (Prosecution's Ex. L) were subjected to the Benzidine test for blood (but the blood was not typed) (R.129) and blood was found present (R.130).
Accused's blood type was proved to be "A" (Prosecution's Ex.0) (R.143). Klara's blood type was proved to be "zero" (R.136). The test of her blood was made while she was in the hospital suffering from injuries (R.136). The "zero" type of human blood in the classification used in Landspitalin Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland, is the same as the "0" type used in the American Army system inasmuch as both are the international system of blood typing (ft, 141, 142).
(51)
Several areas of Private Moore's fatigue clothes were subjected to the Benzidine test, but blood was not found on any of them (R.129).
9.	Private Homer C. Thomas, Battery C, 4-6th Field Artillery Bn. was in the Monroe detail working on the coke dump on the evening of
29	August 1942 (R.92). This witness testified that at 2.15 a.m.,
30	August 1942, he had a conversation with accused at the side of a tj*uck in the rear of the maintenance shop near the coke dump (R.93, 24.6),
Accused asked Thomas to look at his field jacket to see if witness could detect blood on it. The witness could see no blood as the jacket was wet, but asked, accused how he got the blood on it. Accused informed witness that he had killed two Icelandic men and struck a woman with a hatchet (R.93, 24-5)• Thomas asked accused where this happened and accused replied: "Over on the hillside", and being questioned as to who was with him replied: "Moore". Accused then said to witness that he didn't think he had hurt the woman bad, but had just struck her when accused hit at the second Icelandic man and that as accused started to leave the woman grabbed at him and during the scuffling he grabbed, a watch; got hold of it somehow and brought it along with him to prevent discover;'’ of finger prints on it. Witness further stated there were two kids there that kept screaming and hollering and that Moore tried to keep them from getting in ■ the way (R.93, 94-, 24-5, 246). Thomas further testified that accused took
a watch from his pocket book and showed it to witness, and said:	"This	is
the watch I took". Witness said that Prosecution's Ex. E. resembled the watch he saw and the broken strap or wristband on the watch was seen by witness (R.94, 244, 246). Accused did not tell witness that he had bought the watch from Private Moore (R.245).
The witness, Thomas, first fixed the hour of this interview with accused at 4 a.m. 30 August 1942 (R.92); then oh re-direct examination stated the tine of the interview to be between 3.15 a.m. and 3.45 a.m. (R.98). On further cross-examination by the defense, the witness admitted that on investigation of the case he had fixed the time "as between 2 a.m. and 2.30 a.m. or just before quarter to 3" (R.15L). Again on re-crossexamination he admitted his confusion and error as to time and stated that it was 3.15 a.m. - "some where between quarter after 2:00 and quarter to 3:00". Upon being recalled to the stand later in the trial he again changed the time of the conversation to the period from 2:15 a.m. to 3:15 a.m. (R.246). Thomas admitted he made no report of the accused's statement to him until the investigation because he did not believe accused's story (R.247).
10.	On the morning of 30 August 1942 at about 4.30 a.m. Corporal Norman E. Halprin and Private Harold E. Arvin of the 812th Military Police Company, Camp Haggi, were sent to Smaravellir to investigate an 'unusual* occurrence (R.112, 193), and discovered on an investigation of the ground outside the house, a set of false teeth (R.193) and a bloody rag with woman's hair on it (R.193). Later in the morning at about 8:00 o'clock, Col. Moore, Sgt. Dewey Stoner, C.I.I.P., Corporal Halprin, Private Arvin and a civilian police officer returned to the place (R.194, 195).
The hatchet (Prosecution's Ex.F) was found at this time (R.194) and a foot-print in the flower bed near the bed-room window was discovered (R.194). Also a piece of elastic was discovered about 10 ft. from the
hatchet (R.196). Foot-prints about 10 to 12 ft. from the fence and leading directly away from the hatchet (R.196) were also found. Later in the day an old pair of hob-nailed shoes owned by Private Kenneth W. Moore was obtained. Two hob-nails were missing from the sole of the left shoe (R.197). The shoe fitted the foot-print in the flower bed (R.197), and the print also indicated it was made bv a shoe with such hob-nails missing (R.197, 198; Defense Exs. C,D,E,F).
11.	The accused elected to appear as a witness on his own behalf after his rights as such were explained to him (R.201). The evidence is conclusive that the crimes were committed by either accused or Private Kenneth W. Moore. Both Moore and the accused agree that they arrived at Smaravellir at about 2 a.m., 30 August 1942 (See para. 5 hereof). They also agree that they went to Smaravellir to determine whether or not it was a house of prostitution and that at that time they were seeking the company of prostitutes (R.69, 202, 225).
12.	The events which transpired at Smaravellir after the arrival of accused and Private Moore are related by the latter substantially as follows;
Accused v/as dressed- in a rain hat turned up, field jacket, fatigue clothes, leggings and gloves. The trousers of his fatigue clothes were tucked in his leggings (R.62, 66, 82, 85). Moore was dressed in a rain hat, mackinaw, one piece green fatigue suit, hob-nailed shoes, and gloves (R.82, 121) and wore his trousers outside of his leggings (R.64, 82).
' Both of the men entered by the gate and went up to and looked in the bed-room window. There was a light in the bed-room when the men arrived at the house (R.62). When Mooru and the accused looked into the bed-room window the first time they sew a woman standing looking around the room and children in bed. She was in night clothes and had on a black coat or jacket over her night-gown. She wore a watch on her left arm (R.63, 70 71, 74). Moore said to accused: "I don't believe this is a whore house because there are kids in there" (R.72). Accused then went to the front door of the house. Two or three minutes later Moore followed accused and both then went completely around the house, walking to the right (R.62, 70 72). Moore stopped at the bed-room window and accused walked around to the front door (R.62, 72, 73). Moore remained a moment and peered in the bed-room window for a second time and again saw the womaiyfn a night-gown and jacket. She suddenly looked through the curtain hung in the door way leading to the parlor (R.63, 70, 71, 72, 160). Moore then joined the accused at the front door where he saw that the front door was ajar and accused was holding a hatchet (R.62, 74). Moore testified on direct examination that when the two men walked around the house they found a hatchet at the rear of it (R.62) and that at that time accused said:
"It would be good for chopping kindling wood". (R.62, 87). Moore replied: "It would".- On cross-examination he stated that the first time he saw the hatchet was when he joined accused at the front door and at that time the conversation regarding the hatchet occurred (R.75). Moore later stated that the conversation occurred at the corner of the house (R.88). For the third time Moore returned to the bed-room window (R.76, 82), and looked into the bed-room (R.76, 82), and saw the woman poke her head through the drapes of the door (R.76, 82). She spread them apart and
(53)
looked into the next room (R.76). She was dressed in a night-gown and jacket and had the watch on her arm (R.76, 82, 85, 159). Moore remained at the side of the house about two minutes, and hearing the woman scream he went around to the front door (R.77, 82, 160) and looked in the house and saw the woman on the floor. Accused was on top of her beating her head and face with his fists and hands (R.63, 65, 82, 83, 84., 160, 241) •
She was on her left side facing the back of the house. Accused straddled her and had his legs over her chest and was bent over her (R.83). There was a light in the room (R.63). She wore her watch,on her left arm as it lay on the floor by the side of her body (R.86). Accused had a white mask on his face; it looked like a handkerchief (R.63, 65, 85, 240). Moore saw accused's gloves on the floor and picked them up (R.63, 84) and then started to leave. When about ten yards from the door he said: "Watts let's go" (R.24I). Accused replied: "Help me". (R.63, 84, 91). Accused said something, but Moore directed his steps toward the coke pole (R.241). He looked around and saw two children in white clothes out in the yard (R.63, 85). The next time Moore saw accused was at the coke pile, and the two men walked together over to the garage to be relieved from duty (R.63). On the way to the garage Moore asked accused "if he got any". Accused answered: "No", but told Moore he had trouble and threw the hatchet at the Icelandic man and it hit the woman on the side of the head (R.64), After Moore and accused entered the garage, Moore noticed accused with his raincoat off, but wearing his field jacket. It was wet in front and had blood on it. A few minutes later accused showed Moore a watch in his wallet (R.64, 240, 242). Accused said he found the watch down at the house (R.64). Being shown the watch (Prosecution's Ex.E) witness stated it looked like the watch accused had shown him and that, as far as he could remember it was the watch accused had in his wallet. (R.64). Moore also identified the hatchet (Prosecution's Ex.F) as the hatchet accused held in his hand while standing at the front door of Smaravellir (R.64, 65).
13.	The accused's version of the events transpiring at Smarvellir on the night of 29-30 August 1942 is as follows:
Private Moore, accused and several other soldiers were in the vicinity of the first named house for about half an hour. At about 2 a.m., 30 August 1942, Private Moore saw a light over in a distant field and said: "That's a prostitute house over there. Let's go over there".
Accused replied:	"You	sure that is a prostitute house?" Moore replied:
"I am positive that it is"# Accused then said: "Hot/ do you know that it is a prostitute house?" Moore said that some boys told him it was, and continued: "We will go over there. Do you want to go with me?" Accused replied:	"I	don't care if I do". (R.203).
Accused and Moore went over to Smaravellir, Moore leading the way. They was a light in the bed-room. The two men looked in the window, but accused saw no one (R.203, 208). They walked around the house a couple * of times. While in the rear of the house Moore picked up a hatchet he found in the grass. He said: "We will take this in and make a kindling axe out of it". Accused replied: "Yes, it would make a good kindling axe" (R.203). As the pair came up to a window in the rear of the house, Moore
(54)
looked in the window and said: "I see a woman in there". Accused looked in the window and saw a woman in the room. Moore then said: "I see one woman in there". Accused replied: "Yes, one woman is all I see in there". (R.203, 206). The two men then went around to the front of the house.
■Moore tried to open the window in front of the house next to the door, but could not do so. They then went to the door "and smashed down the door latch and the door came open". Moore stepped inside of the house. Accused said to him "Don’t you go in that house". (R.203, 212). Moore gave no answer. Accused then turned, and keeping the house on his left, started for the coke pile, and when about half way round the house he heard a woman’s scream (R.203, 213, 219). He then ran back to the door, and as accused reached the door Moore knocked Klara out of the door^t$n to accused (R.203, 219. 221). Accused thought Moore struck her with the axe at this time (R.225;. She fell on accused, who jumped out of the way. She then sank to the ground, accused reached down and picked up her head. Moore asked:	"Is she killed?" Accused replied: "No, I don’t think she is".
Accused laid Klara back on the ground and stepped back eight or ten feet.
Her head was on the walk and she was gushing blood from her head (R.234). Klara arose and started down the walk, reached the gate and tried to open it. Moore followed her. Accused said:	"Don’t	you	go	down	that walk. Come,
let’s go back and work", Moore went down the walk and as Klara was trying to get the gate open, he hit her on the right side of the head with the back of the axe. When Klara fell to the ground accused ran off (R.204,
213, 221, 222, 224, 225, 228, 230, 237). Moore and accused were at the house for about an hour (R.204, 205). Accused went back to the coke pile and then to the motor maintenance shop (R.205, 211, 216). He met Private Thomas and at the latter place engaged in the following conversation:
Thomas:	"Where	have	you	been?"
Accused: "Me and Private Moore had been over to some Icelander's house".
Thomas:	"What	was	you	doing	over	there?"
Accused: "Private Moore was over there in a fight with some Icelanders. (R.205, 212, 216).
Accused wore a watch on his arm and showed it to Thomas and told him he (accused) had got it from Mioore (R.205, 217).
Accused testified that at the fire near the coke pile a short time after the incidents at Smaravellir, Moore was wearing a wrist watch (R.212.) Moore said: "You want to buy a good watch?" Accused: "What kind of a watch have you got?" Moore: "I got a small wrist watch here". Accused: "What do you want for it?" Moore showed accused a watch and again accused asked:
"What do you want for it?" Moore: "I will take 200 kronur for it". Accused: "O.K. I will buy the watch off%ou". (R.205, 212). Accused then bought the watch and put it on his wrist (R.205, 212, 222). He did not put it in his wallet and the strap was not broken (R.212, 217).
Accused testified he was wearing a field jacket (Prosecution’s Ex.G) which he identified as his own (R.214) and did not know whether or not he got blood on it (R.213, 214)J and that he did not wash it (R.213). He identified Prosecution's Ex.J - underwear - as his own, but stated he did not know whether he got blood on it or not. Accused went to sleep in his
(55)
hut about 6.30 a.m. on 3>0 August 1942, but did not undress. He awakened at about 2.30 p.m., when an investigation had been ordered (R.214). He admitted taking off his clothes when ordered 'by Captain Martin (R.215). He wore the watch on his wrist when he went to sleep, but when he was awakened by Corporal Monroe and was told there was to be a shake-down inspection he took the watch off his wrist and placed it on his bunk intending to turn it in to the Battery Commander. Moore came into the hut about 15 minutes after the Corporal and told him to throw the watch away as there was to be a shake-down (R.205, 206, 215, 228). Monroe and accused were alone at this time (R.205, 215, 216, 228). Accused denied that he put the watch down in the crack between the wall and the floor, and asserted it was on his bunk when he left the hut for the inspection (R.215).
Accused, on cross-examination, stated he saw a little girl come to the front door after Moore had entered the house and was scuffling with the woman, while he was standing on the walk looking through the bed-room window (R.209). He then stated he saw the little girl through the bed-room window (R.210). Then further on in his cross-examination he declared the little seven or eight-year-old girl came to the first or storm door after Moore had pursued Klara to the front gate (R.219, 220, 223, 229) and while he (accused) was standing eight or ten feet from the door (R.220, 223, 224).
Accused declared that on this evening he wore fatigue clothes, blue denim trousers, field jacket, rain hat and leggings with the trousers on the inside of them (R.210). He denied he wore a mask or handkerchief over his face that night (R.220), and also denied there was any blood on his clothing (R.226, 227).
14.	Specification 1 charges accused with the crime of burglary. The elements of this offense are set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial (sec. 149, pg. 168) as follows:
"Burglary is the breaking and entering, in the night, of another's dwelling house, ?/ith intent to commit a felony therein. (Bishop.)
The term "felony" includes, among other offenses so designated at common law, murder, manslaughter, arson, robbery, rape, sodomy, mayhem, and larceny (Irrespective of value). It is immaterial whether the felony be committed or even attempted, and where a felony is actually intended it is no defense that its commission was impossible.
To constitute burglary the house must be a dwelling house of another, the terra "dwelling house" including outhouses within the curtilage or the common inclosure. (Clark & Marshall.)
W Af.A/	V	-V
n7V7V	n ^	A
The house must be in the status of being occupied at the time of the breaking and entering. It is not necessary to this status that anyone actually be in it; but if the house has never been occupied at all or has been left without any intention of returning to it this status does not exist.****
"There must be a breaking, act\ial or constructive. Merely to enter through a hole left in the wall or roof or through an open window or door, even if left only slightly open and	'
pushed farther open by the person entering, will not constitute a breaking; but where there is any removal of any part of the house designed to prevent entry, other than the moving of a partly open door or window, it is sufficient. Thus opening a closed door or window or other similar fixture, or cutting out the glass of a window or the netting of the screen is a sufficient breakage. So also the breaking of an inner door by one who has entered the house without breaking, or by a servant lawfully within the house, but who has no authority to enter the particular room, is a Sufficient breaking, but unless such a breaking is followed by an entry into the particular room with intent to commit a felony therein burglary is not committed.
W VI V	vwu
S A A
An entry must be effected before the offense is complete, but the entry of any part of the body, even a finger, is sufficient; and an insertion into the house of an instrument except merely to facilitate further entrance is a sufficient entry.
Both the breaking and entry must be in the nighttime, which is the period between sunset and sunrise, when there is not sufficient daylight to discern a man’s face, and both must be done with the intent to commit a felony in the house. If the available evidence appears to warrant such action, the actual commission of the felony alleged as intended in the burglary specification should be charged in a separate specification. "
There is substantial evidence in the record establishing the following elements of the crime of burglary:
(a)	At the date of the alleged offense, Smaravellir was a dwelling house occupied as a summer home by Georg and Gudbjorg and their family. (R.7, 34, 47, 52, 54, 55, 56);
(b)	On the evening of 29 August 1942 it was inhabited by Klara, Halla,
Anna II and the infant child (R.5, 6, 28, 52, 53) J
(e) Prior to the breaking, the front doors were closed (R.10);
(d)	The accused actually broke into the dwelling house; he "smashed down the door latch and the door came open” (R.62, 74-, 203, 208);
(e)	The accused entered the dwelling house in the night time (R.6, 63,
65, 67, 68, 82, 83, 84, 160, 241).
The accused admitted the breaking (R.203) but denied he entered the dwelling house (R.203, 218). This presents a conflict between the evidence introduced by the prosecution and accused's testimony. The resolving of this
(57)
conflict was a matter exclusively within the province of the court. It was for the court to determine the probative sufficiency of the testimony and to judge of the credibility of the witnesses. The Board of Review is satisfied with the sufficiency of the evidence to support the finding in respect of the elements of the crime above mentioned.
The Specification alleges that the accused entered Smaravellir with the intent to commit three felonies, (l) rape, (2) robbery and (3) murder therein. This form of pleading is not objectionable.
"An indictment for burglary may lay the offense with several intents, as with intent to steal and intent to murder or to rape, either by alleging the several intents conjunctively in the same count, or by alleging them in separate counts. (9 C.J. sec. 97, pg. 1054 j State vs. Fox 80 IOWA 312, 45 N.W. 874j State vs. Tytus, 58 N.C. 705,
4	S.E. 29).
"Y/here the breach and entry are with intent to commit distinct felonies, - as, rape, larceny, and* murder, -there is but one burglary. On principle, therefore, the indictment may, and for convenience it practically should charge the whole in one count. Hence, if the pleader doubts what felony was intended, he may lay in one count all the probable ones, and proof of any one will suffice. Still the common course seems to have been to put this matter into separate counts - a method not legally ob j ectionaHe."
(3 Bishop's Hew Criminal Procedure (2nd Ed.) sec.150 pg. 1329).
The accepted rule concerning proof of intent is as follows:
"The intent must be proved as laid in the indictment.
An allegation of breaking and entering with intent to corrupt a particular felony is not sustained by proofya breaking with intent to commit some other felony. It is not necessary, however, to prove the whole intent if enough is proved to make out the offense. Thus under an indictment alleging an intent to commit 'grand and petit larceny', an intent to commit either of which is sufficient under the statute, an intent to commit both need not be shown.
People vs. Hall, 94 Cal. 595, 30 Pac.. 7." (9 C.J. sec. 118, pg. 1063).
"As the felonious intent alleged in the indictment is an essential element of the offense, it must be established affirmatively by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, unless there is a statute allowing presumption of intent from the breaking and entry.
(58)
"The intent, however, may, and generally must, be proved by circumstantial evidence, for as a rule it is not susceptible of direct proof. And it has been held that the evidence of intent sufficient to support a conviction of burglary may be slight, in the absence of any evidence that the entry was made with any other intent. The existence, at the time of the breaking and entering, of an intent to commit larceny, rape, murder, or other felony may be inferred as a fact from proof that the felony was actually committed or attempted after the entry, and proof of the actual commission of a felony is the best evidence of the felonious intent. And even where the felony was not actually committed, an intent to commit the same may be inferred from the time and manner at and in which the entry was made, or the conduct of the accused after the entry, or both.
**** *-*•*•*
"An intent to rape may be inferred, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, from the fact that defendant broke and entered through the window of the sleeping room of a girl, put his hand on her person, and, on her awakening, left hurriedly without any explanation, or from other circumstances of a similar character.
"An intent to rob rather than to commit a simple larceny, may be inferred from the. fact that defendant broke and entered the house noisily.****"
(9 C.J., sec. 138, pg. 1078).
The attempt of accused to conceal his identity by masking his face (R.18, 21, 29, 63, 65, 85, 240)j his possession of a hatchet (R.6, 20, 33, 39, 62, 7A) when he entered the housej the vicious and brutal assault he committed on Klara (R.6, 14, 18, 29); the motive which prompted accused to visit Smaravellir (R.61, 69, 202) and the undoubted knowledge possessed by him when he entered the dwelling house that it was not a house of prostitution, and its inmates were not prostitutes (R.72), are facts indisputably established by the evidence. It is most reasonable and logical to conclude from them that accused entered the dwelling house with a lecherous, malignant and.evil intent to secure his own physical satisfaction and in furtherance of such purpose was prepared to use force and violence without limit. While the evidence of intent to commit robbery is not as strong as that supporting the finding of intents to commit rape and murder, it is not Wholly lacking. However, the failure to prove an intent to commit robbery is not fated, under the authorities above quoted, as proof of intent to commit either rape or murder will sustain the finding.
In the opinion of the Board of Review the record is legally stifficient to support the finding of accused's guilt of burglary.
15.	Specification 2 charges the accused with the crime of committing an assault Upon Klara with intent to commit a felony, via: rape. The Manual for Courts-Martial (sec. 14.9, pg. 179) discusses the offense and the proof required to sustain a conviction therefor as follows:
"This (assault with intent to commit rape) is an attempt to commi^rape in which the overt act amounts to an assault upon the woman intended to be ravished.
Indecent advances, importunities however earnest; mere threats, and actual attempts to rape wherein the overt act is not en assault do not amount to this offense. Thus, where a man, intending to rape a woman, steathily concealed himself in her room to await a favorable opportunity to execute his design but was discovered and fled, he was not guilty of an assault with intent to commit rape.
No actual touching is necessary. Thus, when a mem entered a woman's room and got in the bed where she was and within reach of her person for the purpose of raping her he committed the offense under discussion, although he did not touch the woman.
The intent to have carnal knowledge of the woman assaulted by force and without her consent must exist and concur with the assault. In other words, the man must intend to overcome any resistance by force, actual or constructive, and penetrate the woman’s person. Any less intent will not suffice.
Once an assault with intent to commit rape is made, it is no defense that the man voluntarily desisted."
The accused admits (and his admission in this respect is confirmed by the testimony of Private Kenneth W. Moore) that he and Moore went to Smaravellir on the night of 29 August 1942 seeking the company of prostitutes,. Either one or both of them had been informed that Smaravellir was a house of ill-fame (R.61, 69, 203, 206, 208), This fact stands uncontradicted in the record, and is the true and only reason for the two men going to the house of Georg and Gudbjorg that evening. Both of them were prompted by lustful and lecherous desires (R.225).
A comparison of the testimony of the two men as to events transpiring before the house was entered shows a striking and cogent difference which is highly Important in considering the offense under Specification 2. They agree that when they arrived at the house that they both saw Klara in the house, Moore claims he also saw the children (R.63) and then expressed to accused his doubt that the house was one of prostitution (R.72). Accused in his testimony is entirely silent as to the presence of children in the house (R.203, 208).. In fact he testified that he did not see the little girls until after Moore went into the house (R.208, 209). Further he does not refer to Moore's statement: "I don't believe this is a whore house because there are kids in there" (R.72). It seems therefore but reasonable to believe that accused continued to carry in his mind his original purpose of seeking sexual intercourse. The failure of accused, in his testimony, to break this connection between his original design and his ultimate actions,
and his positive statement that he did not see the little girls until after Moore entered the house are ar. unconscious exposure of accused's evil intentions when he assaulted Klara. Such conclusion is not only consistent with subsequent events, but also is one that the Court in weighing and reconciling the evidence was at liberty to draw.
Klara testified that the man who assaulted her felt with his hands up her pant legs and tore her pants (R.9). He committed a brutal battery upon her (R.6, 14, 18, 29). He gagged her with a rag (R.6, 14, 18) and as she lay prostrate on the floor he was straddle of her (R.63, 65, 82, 83, 84, 160, 241J. That the assault was ferocious is indicated by the large pool of blood and numerous blood stains on the floor of the room discovered by Trausti (R.4-5, 49).
Moore's testimony contains an illuminating bit of evidence as to accused's intentions in committing the assault upon Klara. In relating the conversation between him (Moore) and accused in the maintenance garage after the events at Smaravellir, Moore states: "I asked him if he rot any ? He told me personally no. Then he told me he had trouble down there ****" (R.64). This colloquy between Moore and the accused, can be interpreted only to mean that both men were conscious at all times of their purpose in visiting Smaravellir and that both men knew accused assaulted Klara for the purpose of obtaining sexual intercourse with her.
The Board of Review is of the opinion that there is sufficient evidence in the record, to sustain the finding that accused committed an assault upon Klara with intent to commit a felony, viz: rape. The weight and sufficiency of the evidence was for the Court to determine, and having resolved it against accused no basis exists for disturbing the finding.
16.	Specification 3 charges robbery. The gravamen of the offense is that accused by force and violence and by putting Klara in fear did feloniously take, steal, and carry away from her person a ladies wrist watch of the value of about §20,40. Robbery is defined by the Manual of Courts-Martial (sec. 148, pg. 170) as follows:
"Robbery is the taking, with intent to steal, of the personal property of another, from his person or in his presence,,against his will, by violence or intimidation. (Clark.) ****".
"The taking must be against the owner's will by means of violence or intimidation. The violence or intimidation must precede or accompany the taking,.
"The violence must be actual violence to the person, but the amount used is immaterial. It is enough where it overcomes the actual resistance of the person robbed, or puts him in such a position that he makes no resistance, or suffices to overcome the resistance offered by a chain or other fastening by which the article is attached to the person."****
The evidence estaolishes beyond doubt that Klara was the ovmer of a ladies' wrist watch (Prosecutions Ex.B) on the evening of 29 August 1942 (R.80); that the watch possessed some definite value on that date (R.79, 80); that she had it on her left arm at the time she was seen by Moore through the bed-room window (R.63, 70, 71, 74); that she had it on the same arm as she lay prostrate on the floor of the parlor when accused was beating her (R.85, 86) and that she likewise wore it when accused carried her outside of the house and threw her on the ground (R.10)« According to Moore the accused showed him in accused's wallet a ladies' wrist watch with a broken strap on it while Moore and accused were in the maintenance garage later in the evening (n.64. 240, 242). The accused stated he found the watch down at Smaravellir (E.64). Private Thomas testified that he met accused the same evening in the maintenance garage and accused informed him that he (accused) had killed two Icelandic men and struck a woman with a hatchet; that as he started to leave the woman grabbed at him and during the scuffling accused grabbed a watch and got hold of it somehow and brought it along to keep anyone from finding finger-prints on it (R.93, 94-, 245, 246). Thomas further testified that accused took a watch from his pocket-book and showed it to Thomas stating: "This is the watch I took," Accused did not tell Thomas he had bought watch from Moore (R.245). The watch had a broken wrist band or strap on it when seen by Thomas (R.94, 244, 246). The watch (Prosecution's Ex.E) was found on 31 August 1942 in the crack between the wall and floor of the hut. in which accused slept, at a place where accused's cot had .been (R.104, 105;. Klara identified Prosecution's Ex.E. in open court as being the watch she wore on her arm at the time of the assault (R.10).
The Accused denied all of the foregoing and stated he purchased the watch from Moore for 200 Kronur (R.204, 205, 212, 216, 217, 222). He claims he showed the wa-tch to Thomas and informed him he had bought it from Moore (R.205, 217).
There was thereby created a sharp conflict between the evidence for the prosecution and that of accused. It was the function of the Court to resolve this conflict. It was at liberty to believe the evidence of the prosecution and disbelieve that of accused. By its finding it has indicated its acceptance of prosecution's evidence. In the opinion of the Board of Review there is legally sufficient evidence to support the Court's findings.
There is but one possible question that can arise in connection with the legality of the finding and that is whether or not accused took the watch from Klara's person.
The applicable rule of law is stated as follows:
"Since robbery is an offense against the person as well as against property, it is essential to the crime that there should be a taking from the 'person' of the victim. To satisfy this requirement, however, it is sufficient if the property be taken from his 1presence1. In other words, the property must be actually or constructively taken from the person, or as some authorities have phrased the rule, it must be taken from the 'person or presence', or from the 'person or possession' of the victim."
(54 C.J., sec.20, pg.1015).
(62)
"At common law it is not necessary that the property should be taken from the physical person rof the victim, the requirement that it be taken from his 'person1 being satisfied if it is taken from his ’presence'(54C.J., sec.21, pg.1015)
"An indictment or information charging a taking from the 'person' may be supported by proof a taking from the 'presence', as such proof does not constitute a fatal variance." (54 C.J., sec,136, pg.1052). ;
There is substantial evidence establishing the fact that Klara had the watch on her arm when accused assaulted her with the axe or hatchet after he had carried her outside of the house (R.6, 11, 16). Admittedly there is no direct evidence that accused pulled the watch from Klara's arm nor is there any proof that he picked it up from the ground if 'it had slipped from her arm as she was thrown on the ground. However, the watch was on her arm when accused carried her out of doors. The fact that the leather strap or wrist band of the watch when shown to Moore and Thomas by accused and when produced in court was broken creates a strong implication that accused pulled it from her arm. However, it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove specifically that it was snapped from her arm by accused. The evidence is convincing that if accused did not take it from Klara's person he did take it from her presence. This is sufficient. Taking property from the presence of a person and under his direct physical personal control, as where the property is lying beside the victim, is the equivalent of taking from his person. (Rice v. State, 204 Alabama 104, 85 Southi 437; Douglass v State. 98 Fla. 289, 107 South 791, 793; 54 C.J., sec.21, pg.1015, Ann* 39).
Although the specification alleges it was taken from her person, there was no variance between the averment and proof. Evidence of taking from Klara's presence is#adequate. (54 C.J., sec.136, pg.1052).
17.	Specification 4 charges accused with assaulting Klara with a dangerous instrument, viz: a hatchet with intent to commit murder. The elements of the crime are declared by the Manual of Courts-Martial (sec.149, pg.178) to be as follows:
"Assault with intent to murder.— This is an assault aggravated by the concurrence of a specific intent to murder; in other words, it is an attempt to murder. As in other attempts there must be an overt act, beyond mere preparation or threats, or an attempt to make an attempt. To constitute an assault with intent to murder by firearms it is not necessary that the weapon be discharged; and in no case is the actual infliction of injury necessary. Thus, where a man with intent to murder another deliberately assaults him by shooting at him, the fact that he misses does not alter the character of the offense. Where the intent to murder exists, the fact that for some reason unknown the actual consummation of the murder is impossible by the means employed does not
"prevent the person using them fron being guilty of an assault with intent to commit murder where the means are apparently adapted to the end in view.
Thus, where a soldier intending to murder another loads his rifle with what he believed to be a ball cartridge and aims and discharges his rifle at the other, it is no defense that he, by accident, got hold of a blank cartridge.****"
A more specific analysis of the offense is stated thus:
"An intentional attempt by violence with present ability, or in some jurisdictions, apparent ability, and without legal excuse or provocation, to do an injury to the person of another, accompanied by facts and circumstances indicative of an intent to take life, constitutes the offense of assault with intent to murder.****" (30 C.J., sec.153, pg.15).
"In addition to the requisite intent, in order to constitute an assault with intent to murder, there must be an attempt or an assault to carry out that intention. In other words, there must be an overt aot in pursuance of the intent as distinguished from the mere intent itself, and also from mere threats, or mere preparations not going far enough to constitute an attempt. There must be commencement of an act which if not prevented would produce a battery.**** (30 C.J., sec.159, pg.16)
"Malice or malice aforethought is an essential ingredient of assault with intent to murder. As in the case of murder, malice may(be either express or implied. While the expression 'malice aforethought includes the element of premeditation, it is immaterial for how short a time the malice may have existed.****" (30 C.J., sec.163, pg.20),
"In General. The specific intent to take human life is an essential element of the offense of assault with intent to commit murder, and conversely where an unjustifiable assault is made by one capable of cool reflection and not in the heat of passion, with the intention of killing, it will constitute an assault with intent to kill where death does not result. The requisite intent, however, may be inferred from the attendant circumstances and may be formed upon the instant of the assault.****"
(30 C.J., sec,l6A, pg.20).
(64)
"Tihile a specific intent to kill is an essential ingredient of the offense of assault with intent to commit murder, this requirement does not exact an intent, other than an intent which is inferrable from the circumstances. So while the intent cannot be implied as a matter of law, it may be inferred	'
as a fact from the surrounding circumstances, such as the unlawful use of a deadly weapon,' provided it was used in such a manner as to indicate an intention to kill, or from an act of violence from -which, in the usual and ordinary course of things, death or great bodily harm may result. Other circumstances which may be considered as bearing upon the propriety of an inference of intent are:
The character of the assault, the nature or extent of the wound or injury, the presence or absence of excusing and palliating facts or circumstances, and prior threats. The question of intent as dependent upon the physical circumstances and the impression made by them on the mind of defendant must be determined by the facts as they were perceived or tinderstood by defendant. Where the weapon used was manifestly not of a deadly character and there was nothing in the manner of its use to indicate an intention to take life, a conviction of assault with intent to murder cannot be sustained. The lethal character of the weapon used in making an assault may be inferred from the effect and nature of the wound inflicted."
(30 C.J., sec.165, pg.2l).
Klara was positive that she was struck on the head by an axe or hatchet after she had been carried outside of the house by the man who had in the parlor previously beaten her. (R.6, 11, 16). The proof shows that she was suffering from concussion of the brain when she was taken to the hospital and that she sustained a fractured skull. She was in the hospital for five weeks (R.135). The skull fracture resulted from a hard blow on thfl top of the head (R.139, 140). Prosecution's Ex.F - a ha+ :het - was identified as being the property of Georg and Gudbjorg (R.53, 54) and it was discovered on 30 August 1942 near the scene of the alleged crime with woman's hair on it (R.112, 196). This hatchet was in the possession of accused preceding and at the time he entered the house (R.6,- 23, 29, 62,
75, 87). Even the accused himself admits that he and Moore found the hatchet in the rear of the house (R.203). Klara's declaration that she was carried into the yard and there hit with an axe or hatchet receives corroboration from Traustle's testimony as to Klara's return to the house (R.11,* 16, 46) with unkempt hair; in a disheveled condition and bruised and with bloody (R.22, 46, 48, 53, 57) face and head. There is a sufficiency of proof in the record to sustain the finding of the court that it was the accused who struck Klara with a hatchet, and in the opinion of the Board of Review the Court could not have found otherwise under the evidence.
(65)
The proof of (a) apparent ability of the accused to inflict the assault; (b) the absence of provocation, and (c) the overt act is so complete and obvious that further recital or analysis of the evidence is not required to demonstrate that the prosecution fully sustained its burden of proof in regard to these elements of the crime. Is there sufficient proof of the intention of the accused to commit murder?
As a matter of law a hatchet, when used to strike a human being, is a deadly weapon (People vs. Shaw, 1 Park Cr. (N.Y.) 327; State V3. Shields, 110 N.C. 497, 14 S.E. 779; Dains vs. State, 2 Hump. (Tenn.)
439)• This fact when considered in connection with the seriousness of the injury inflicted on Klara; the time and place of the assault and the circumstances that it followed upon accused’s attempt to rape her; the total absence of any evidence of provocation; the theft of Klara's watch and the immediate departure of accused from the scene of his crimes- form a substantial and reliable body of evidence from which the Court could legitimately and logically infer the specific intent upon the part of accused to kill Klara when he struck her on the head with the hatchet.
In the opinion of the Board of Review the record is legally sufficient to sustain the finding of guilty of assault with intent to commit murder.
18.	The accused's defense is a denial of the charges against him and an attempt on his part to fix on Moore the responsibility for the crimes. Thus arose an issue of fact for the Court to determine, and it was solely within its province. An examination of accused's testimony reveals several unexplained inaccuracies and inconsistencies which undoubtedly influenced the Court in judging of its credibility. A reading of his testimony as it appears in the record does not create belief in his veracity. There is a glibness about it that bespeaks falsity. It probably had the same affect upon the Court. On the other hand both Moore and Thomas do not appear as witnesses of unquestionable, veracity. The accused presented evidence of contradictory statements made by both witnesses out of court, many of which remained unexplained, which weakened their testimony. However, in the main, their stories possess the quality of truth.
Evidence connecting accused directly with the crimes is that of the laboratory analysis made of the blood on accused’s clothing which he wore on the night of 29-30 August 1942. While probably not of the degree of scientific accuracy that it is possible to produce, yet for practicable purposes it is highly convincing. Its fallibility was for the Court to judge. The fact that human blood was found on accused's underwear, field jacket and O.D. pants and that the blood on accused's underwear, tinder the international system of blood-typing, wa3 "0" (or zero) and that Klara's blood is of the type "zero” is evidence of cogent, relevant value that cannot be disregarded. The accused offered the explanation of the presence of blood on his clothing (while disclaiming knowledge of such fact) that it got on him when Klara was thrown against him by Moore (R.203. 218, 219, 221) or when he raised Klara's head from the ground (R.234). It is difficult to believe this story in the face of the
testimony of Captain Taylor concerning amount of blood found on accused's underwear and O.D. trousers (R.127, 128, 129, 130). The admission by accused that he had possession of Klara's watch under the explanation that he purchased same from Moore and its discovery in the crack between wall and floor of accused’s hut near at a point where accused's cot had been standing is further evidence pointing to accused as the actual perpetrator of the crimes. The description by Klara, Halla and Anna of the "blue" clothing worn by the man who entered Smaravellir and the fact that Halla speaks of "brown" shoes (R.39) worn by him possesses some probative value when it is considered that accused wore a fatigue uniform, which is of a shade of blue and that his leggings (brown in color) (R.7) w?re "outside" or "over" his fatigue trousers - easily to be confused with brown shoes.
The absence of blood on Moore's fatigue clothes (R.141, 142) is at least some corroborating evidence of his version of the affair.
Moore was not an accomplice of accused (Bird vs. United States,
187 U.S. 118, 133; 47 L.Ed. 100, 106; 16 C.J., sec.1357, pg.674-). However, if it be assumed that he was an accomplice, a conviction may be had on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice although such testimony is to be regarded with great caution (M.C.M., sec.124, pg.132). In this case, Moore's evidence was corroborated in many important details, as had been shown above.
It is no duty of the Board of Review to weigh or evaluate the evidence in this case, nor to balance inconsistencies nor to reconcile conflicts therein. That is exclusively the function of the trial Court, which had the advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses and judging of their conduct on the stand and the manner in which they gave their testimony. Questions concerning their credibility and honesty were exclusively for the Court to answer. The foregoing discussion of the evidence is intended to show that there is sufficient, creditable evidence in the record to sustain the finding of the Court that it was accused, who committed the crimes charged and not Moore.
19.	In the record there appears the report of the Board of Officers appointed pursuant to paragraph 35(c) M.C.M., and under the provisions of AR 600-500. The conclusion of the Board is that there is no evidence that accused is insane or mentally defective.
20.	The sentence of the court, which has been approved by the reviewing authority, is legal. The accused, Watts, was 22 years old at the time of the commission of the offenses. Pursuant to General Order 37, ETQUSA, 9 September 1942, paragraphs 5(c) and (d), execution of sentence of dishonorable discharge will be ordered only when accused has been convicted of an offense which renders his retention in the service undesirable, and when he has also been sentenced to a term of not less than three years confinement. A general prisoner whose approved sentence to confinement is three years or more may be returned to the United States for service of such sentence, without the express orders of Hdqr. ET0USA. The offenses of which the accused has been convicted renders his retention in the military service undesirable and inasmuch as confinement is for
30 years, the execution of the sentence of dishonorable discharge, and the
CONFIDENTIAL
(67)
return of the accused to the United States for service of sentence, are proper. War Department directive (AG 253 (2-6-4l)E)26 February 1941, requires prisoners under 31 years of age and with sentences of not more than 10 years to be confined in a Federal Correctional Institution or Reformatory. Inasmuch as accused is sentenced to confinement for 30 years the action of the reviewing authority correctly fixed the United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, as the place of confinement of accused.
21.	The court was legally constituted and had jurisdiction of the offenses involved. No error injuriously affecting the substantial rights' of the accused were committed during the trial. The Board of Review is of the opinion that the record of trial is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty and the sentence.	/
