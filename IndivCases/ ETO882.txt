to be confined at hard labor for three years. The reviewing authority approved each of the sentences and designated the federal Reformatory, Chillicothe, Ohio, as the place of confinement of each accused, and forwarded the record of trial for action pursuant to Article of War 50J-.
3.	Prosecution's evidence establishes the following facts*
On 5 August 19A3 accused Biondiwas a member of 7th Air Depot Group (Repair Squadron) and accused White Was a member of the 33rd Air Depot Group (Repair Squadron) jr both squadrons being of VIII Air Force Service Command*- On said date they were stationed at AAF Station 590,
APO 635, which was ‘at or near Sankey, Warrington, Lancashire, England.
Miss Margaret Moores, age 20, a brewery bottler by occupation, resided at 89 Southworth Avenue, Warrington, On the evening df 5 August 1943 Miss Moores (hereinafter called "Margaret" for convenience) at about the hour of 10*20 o'clock was standing on a bridge over St. Helen's canal. :
She was approached by White who asked her if "her time was booked". She repliedi "I am waiting for a boy friefnd" (R8,l2), She had never seen or talked with White previously. White then asked her to escort him across the field. She went halfway with him and then informed him that she was going home. After progressing a distance, she sat down on the grass with him. White kissed her to which she made no objections, and followed same by attempting indecent familiarities with her by putting his hand under her clothes. She repulsed him by saying to himi "Xou are not doing anything like that to me". She immediately stood up and attempted to run away (R9,12,18-19).	White followed her, chasing her about the field. He
finally caught her and held her in his arms. At this moment Biondi> appeared on the scene. White called to him "to corns and help him". Both accused then forced Margaret to the ground and laid her on her back.
White grasped her two hands and pulling them above her head pressed them, to the ground. An unidentified soldier appeared who grasped her ankles and spread her legs apart and held them. Margaret's dress had been pulled up and her naked 'thighs were exposed. - Biondi .was between Margaret's extended legs and laid upon her. She struggled to free herself and screamed once. White then placed his hand wer h$r mouth (R9,
11-U,17-19,34,37,39).
■ • ,
A thirteen-year old boy, Cyril Maher, 60 Ilford Avenue, Warrington, between 11*00 and 11*30 p.m, on 5 August 1943 saw Margaret in the field: being chased by two American soldiers one of whom he identified as Biondi (R24,27-28),	Cyril approached within ten yards of the trio and saw one
of the soldiers tackle the girl around the legs and throw her on to the ground. She lay on her back (R26), Biondi saiji to Cyril* "Take a powder". Cyril asked* "What does powder mean?" Biondi struck at Cyril with his hand and said* "Soram". Cyril ran to the field gate where Kenneth Powell, age 16, of St. Lawrence, Lodge Lane, Bewsey, was standing. Cyril informed Kenneth as to the events he had observed in the field (R26, 30,34). Kenneth walked into the field and saw Margaret on the ground with one man holding her ankles; another was on his knees between her legs

and a third was bending over her holding her hands to the ground, which were stretched parallel, with her body and above her head. Margaret's clothing was above-her thighs. She was struggling and crying. She said "Stop it". Kenneth told Margaret'that her mother wanted her. She made no reply. The soldier who held her hands told Kenneth to "scram" (R26,
31,3-4—35) •	Kenneth returned to the. field gate and informed an American
soldier, George Anderson, what was' happening. Anderson declined to do anything, stating it did not concern him (R25-26,32). . In close proximity were Sergeant Hoyle B. Koontz (3443514-5), Sergeant Leslie M. Pope (34467053), Private first class Ellis J. Lanier (34594764), Private first class James A. Jones (34467257), Private Shannon G. Hodge (34594612), and Private Lloyd F. Ray (34594450) all of Battery D, 461st Coast Artillery Battalion (R36).	Kenneth informed Koontz.that two-"fellows" had a girl on the .
ground.	Koontz with the other soldiers' went into the field. White was
holding Margaret’s hpids above her head; Biondi was lying on top of her.
The girl’s legs were' held apart by a third unidentified man. The lower part of her body was nude. She was struggling and crying "Don’t, stop it" (R37,39,43,47,49,50,52,53,56).	Koontz yelledt "What the hell are you
doing7" Lanier grabbed Biondi around the neck and pulled him off Margaret. Jones struck White-with his fist and removed bjm from Margarets arms. A scuffle ensued. White started to run but was captured. The third unidentified man escaped into the woods. Koontz said to Biondi that "just because he was in England he couldn't get away with it like that", Biondi replied* PI am sorry, I will never do it again". .Margaret upon being _ released left the scene (R37-38,40,45,47,51,54).
Sergeant Alfred G. Prince, 1108 Military Police Company, secured, from accused Biondi some of his underwear consisting of "trunks" or "shorts" which Prince identified in court. Biondi informed Prince that he had- worn the trunks on the night of the. incident and removed them in Prince’s presence. Prince took them back to headquarters and delivered them to Sergeant Thomas J. Horan of the 890th Police Company (R57). Horan identified trunks shown,, him in court as the trunks he received from Prince on 7 August 1943, and delivered to Detective Inspector Hays of the Widnes Station on the same date (R58). Hays delivered them to Dr. David Hoel Jones, -Staff Biologist and Bacteriologist at the Home Office Science Laboratory in Preston on 9 Aug”st 1943 (R59). The Detective. Inspector at ItOO a.m. 7 August 1943 secured from Margaret the pair of knickers which she wore on the night of 5 August 1943 (R20-21). Hays delivered the knickers to Dr. Jone3 at the same time he delivered the trunks (R60).
Dr. Jones made an examination of the trunks and the knickers. He found an the knickers extensive stains of a vaginal discharge containing a large number of pus cells and bacteria. He also examined and tested the trunks. There was on the front of the trunks a small yellow stain similar in appearance to the stain on the knickers. Upon examination he discovered that the stain on the trunks was of the same constitution as the stain on the knickers. It contained a large number x£ bacteria and pus cells of the Identical type and kind as found on the knickers. Dr. Jones was of the opinion it was a probability that the pus cells found on the trunks and

the knickers* came from the same person (R61-62).
A. The defense produced Private Fred Lane whose unit is not shown, who testified he was,with the.group of American soldiers near the field-gate on the night of. 5 August 19A3 when a hoy approached them and informed them that a hunch of • boys was "sheep-shanking” a girl over in the field (R63). He approached with the group of soldiers to a position about ten paces from the girl. He saw one soldier holding the girl’s hands, another was holding her feet and a third was on top of her. She was struggling.
He then made a jump at the soldiers and a fight ensued in which he was injured.- He could recognise.no one in th%6ourt room who was present and could not identity either the men or the girl involved (R6A).
The accused Biondi was duly warned of his rights and elected to make a sworn statement. He testified in substance as follows!
On the evening of 5 August 1943, White and a girl were standing in a field about one hundred yards from the field gate. They were engaged in conversation. Biondi came up to them. The three of them sat down on the grass. After they sat down Biondi put his arms around the girl’s neck. He did not try to kiss her. At this moment seven or eight American soldiers came up to them. . White .was sitting close to the girl .(R66-67).
One of the soldiers came over and jumped on top of Biondi who arose and got away from him. Another, hit him -on -the back of his head and knocked him down. He made no remarks and ran away (R&7). Biondi upon cross-examination attempted to claim that Margaret was not the girl to whom he made improper advances. The pertinent colloquy is as follows! .
"Q. And you didn’t attempt in any way whatsoever to have intercourse with Kiss Moores?
A. Ho sir. .
Q. I want to ask you whether you made the following statement to Sgt. T.J. Horani •
’After sitting with her a few minutes I put my arm around her and tried to have . intercourse with her’.
A. Yes sir.
Q. You made that statement?
A. Yes.
Q. Why is it that you have changed your mind now and say you didn’t have intercourse wd,th her?
A. Not her I didn’t.
Q. You did attempt to have intercourse with i	a girl?	.
A. Yes, if there was another one. It wasn't . her.
Q. There was a girl you attempted to have intercourse with. Let's talk about this girl you attempted to have intercourse

with. Were you with this girl when the other soldiers came up?
A, Yes.	/
Q. ’.That position were you in with relation to the other girl when the soldiers came up?
A* Sitting down beside her,
Q. In what way did you attempt to have intercourse with this girl?
A. On her own concern.
Q. Describe to the Court what you did in attempting to Have intercourse with her,
A. I didn't sit there long enough to try to have sexual intercourse with her,
Q. You have just said you were there with the girl and attempted to have intercourse with her.
A. I just sat there with my arm around her and I didn't have chance to have intercourse with her before the boys came.
Q. And that is all you did in attempting to have intercourse with her?
A. Yes." (R69-70).
He did not recognise the soldiers who attacked him, nor had he previously known White or the girl. He did' not "learn the girl's name that evening. He denied he had seen either Cyril Maher or Kenneth Powell in the "field that evening and asserted that"11 All "I saw was soldiers11 (R7A).
The record fails to show that White was informed as to his rights to testify, make an unsworn "statement or to remain silent. He was not a witness and he made no unsworn statement.
5. A serious question is presented in connection with the charge against accused, Vfiiite. Eliminating from the specification all descriptive allegations, the same is as follows*
" Private Bert Biondi ***, did, in conjunction with Private Charles "H^ White **** with intent to commit a felony, viz,'rape, commit an assault upon Margaret Moores by wilfully and feloniously dragging and throwing the said Margaret Moores upon the ground."
With respect to the form of. specification in charging a joint offense the I/knual for Courts-Martial provides as follows*
- 5 -
CONFIDENTIAL
<u)
CONFIDENTIAL
"f. Form of specification in joint offense.-% In the case of a joint offense each accused ■ may be charged-as if he alone was concerned or the specifications may be in accordance with the principles of the following examples, depending on the decision of the person preferring the charges as to how the persons concerned should be tried*
In that Private A, Company —,-----Infantry,
and Private C, Company —, —1 Infantry, acting jointly, and in pursuance of a common Intent, did (here allege place, time and offense as when charging one person). .
In that Private A, Company. —, — Infantry, and Private B, Company —, — Infantry, acting jointly and in pursuance of a common intent, did, in conjunction with Private C?

---Infantry, and Private B, Company —, —-	, •
Infantry (here allege place, time and offense)." y (1EM., 1928, appendix 4, par.f, p.237).	•»'
It is manifest that the specification in the instant case is based on the third’ of the suggested forms above set forth. An analysis of the three forms will reveal their exact purpose*	.'r'...
(a)	The first form is intended for use when A and C are all of the joint perpetrators of a crime and it Is intended that they should be charged jointly and shall be tried. (All of the joint perpetrators are charged together and are to he tried).
(b)	The second form is intended for use when A, B and C are the joint perpetrators of a crime, and it is intended that only A and B shall be charged jointly and shall be tried but that C, while joint actor is neither to be charged nor tried. (Two or more of the joint perpetrators are charged and are to be tried, but one or more are not to be charged and tried).
(c)	The third form is intended for use when A, B and C are the joint perpetrators’ of a crime and it is intended that only A shall be charged and tried but that B and C while joint actors are neither to be charged nor tried.] (Only one of the joint perpetrators is charged and is to be tried, and one or more are not to be charged and tried).
Certain fundamental principles of pleading must be observed in drafting specifications and the primary one is that a specification "must specify the material facts necessary to constitute .the alleged offense".

('.Tint hr op’s Military Law & Precedents, Reprint, p.l33j IBM., 1928, par.29,
p.18).
"An indictment, information or complaint must be positive in respect to the charge that the person accused committed the crime which renders him amenable to the charge and must directly and positively allege every fact necessary to constitute the crime. Nothing can be charged by implication or intendment, nor is it sufficient to charge any material matter by way of argument, or as based on suspicion; the offense cannot be charged on information and belief, nor can the averments be aided by imagination or presumption. **-*»
(31 C.J., sec.179, p.659).
"The allegation of the indictment or information must be direct and certain as to the person charged.	(31	C.J., sec.226, p.689).
The v/ords of action in the present specification are "did *** commit an assault". It is Biondi who is specifically connected with this verb phrase -."Biondi *** did ** commit an assault". The prepositional phrase "in connection with *** White" is descriptive only; it describes with whom Biondi was associated in the commission of the assault. The prepositional phrase "with an intent to commit a felony" refers to Biondi, not White.
The meaning of the specification becomes obvioust
"Biondi, in conjunction with Thite, and with intent to commit a felony, did commit an assault etc."	1
There is, therefore, no allegation that White committed any offense. The specification violates the fundamental principle of pleading that the "indictment, information or.complaint must be positive in respect to the charge that the person accused committed the crime which renders him amenable to the charge". The result is that the instant specification fails to allege a cause of action against White. He was brought to trial upon a specification which was fatally defective as to him. Such defect was not waived by his plea to the general issue, nor by his failure to raise the question during triad. It was an organic defect which nullified the whole prosecution against White. It may be considered by the Board of Review upon appellate review (17 C.J., sec.3330, p.55, footnote 92; 24. CJ5., sec.1671, footnote 30, p.275; CM 201710, Reynolds (1933)).
The provisions of the 37th Article of War do not permit the Board of Review to ignore this situation. The Manual for Courts-Martial in amplifying the purpose of said article states:
- 7 -
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
U6)
"No finding or sentence need be disapproved solely because a specification is defective if the facts alleged therein and reasonably .	implied	therefrom constitute an offense,
unless it appears from .the record that the accused was in fact misled by such defect, or that his substantial rights were in fact otherwise injuriously affected thereby".
(lOt., 1928, par.87b, p.74).
The error in the specification as against White, is not a defective statement of facts constituting an. offense. It wholly fails to. allege that White committed any offense. As a consequence the defect is not within the purview of the curative statute, and is fatal to these proceedings.
*"There can be no trial, conviction, or punishment for a crime without a formal and sufficient accusation. In the absence thereof the court acquires no jurisdiction whatever, and if it assumes jurisdiction, a trial and conviction are a nullity. *-**" (31 Corpus Juris, sec.l,
P.559).	.	'	.	•	.
The Board of Review, therefore, concludes, that as to accused White the record of trial is legally insufficient to’support'the findings of guilty and the sentence.
6. Separate charge sheets were originally prepared as to each accused, Biondi was charged with committing rape upon. Margaret under AW 92; White was charged with an assault upon Margaret with intent to commit a felony, viz: rape, under AW 93. Both charges were referred to Major Edwyn G, Rydlun, AC., for investigation under the 70th Article of War. In his report he expressed the.opinion that the.evidence did not sustain the __charge cf rape a gainst Biondi and recommended that he be charged with assault with intent to commit rape under AW 93. The investigating officer recommended that White be brought to trial as charged.'
Upon reference to the staff judge advocate he altered the charge sheet in the case against Biondi by striking out the charge of rape and inserting in lieu thereof a charge against Biondi under AW 93 of a felon-' ious assault with intent to commit rape upon Margaret. On the White charge sheet he eliminated the.original charge a gainst White of felonious assault with intent to commit rape and inserted in lieu thereof a charge against Biondi under AW 93 of felonious assault upon Margaret, with intent to commit rape, "in conjunction with" White. He then eliminated from the Biondi charge sheet the substituted charge under AW 93 of felonious assault with intent to commit rape and upon the White charge sheet first struck out the substituted charge against Biondi of felonious assault, and then reinstated it in the’identical language set forth in paragraph 2 supra. Based upon this action the staff judge advocate recommended trial of both accused upon charges of assault ±m with intent to commit a felony, viz: rape.
- 8 -

(47)
The result of these alterations is: (a) the original charge sheet against Biondi carries no charges against him inasmuch as both the original and substituted charges were eliminated; (b) the original charge sheet against White carries no valid, legal charge against him for the reasons set forth in paragraph 5, supra, and (c) the charge'against Biondi appears on the original White charge sheet. In preparing the charge sheets in final form the third and fourth pages of the Biondi original charge sheet were » eliminated but the single charge against Biondi (appearing on the original White charge sheet) remained over the verifying affidavit of the White charge sheet.
Both charge sheets show that the accuser - Captain Jesse B. Kritzer - did not initial all or any of the alterations in the charge sheets. The initials appearing are evidently those of a subordinate officer in the office of the staff judge advocate. The alterations in respect to Biondi were of such a nature as to be proper without re-verification by the accuser, and the substitution of the charge of assault with intent to commit a felony, viz: rape, in lieu of the charge of rape did not require a re-investigation (CM ETO 106, Orbon).
It is obvious that the staff judge advocate intended the charge sheet against both accused should consist of: (a) the first page of the original Biondi charge sheet; (b) in the first page of the original White charge sheet; (c) a third page which carried the charge which he supposed was valid against both accused; '(d) a fourth page carrying the verification and indorsement of reference for trial, and (e) a fifth page showing certificate of service. Manifestly, he acted upon the assumption that the charge in the final form and upon which trial was had was a valid and legal charge against both Biondi and White. In this conclusion he was in error, as is above demonstrated.	It failed to charge White with any offense, but was
valid as to Biondi.	While the above practice is not to be 'commended the
charge sheet in final form adequately informed accused Biondi of the nature of the charge against him. He could not possibly have been misled.
I
7.	The form of the plea of the two accused - "To the Specification of the Charge - Not guilty. To the Charge - Not guilty" (R5) is irregular.
The plea of each accused should have been separate and several and the same
' should have been recorded separately in the record of trial (MCM., 1928, par.49c, p.38). Inasmuch as White was never legally before the court because of the fatally defective specification, the plea was applicable only to Biondi and in its present form it is obvious that he pleaded "Not Guilty".
8.	The motion of the defense counsel "for an acquittal" may properly be treated as a motion for a finding of not guilty. It was made on behalf of accused jointly on the ground that specific intent to commit a felony had not been proved (R62), Had defense counsel in his motion pointed out ' to the court the fatal defect in the specification when applied to White, the court should have granted the motion as to him. However, the failure of counsel to make his motion in proper form was not a waiver of the error (See par,5, supra) as to White. The motion as to Biondi was properly
- 9 -

CONFIDENTIAL
(48)
denied* The prosecution had clearly made its case against him at the time of the motion. (GM ETO 527, Astrella). '	*
9* Biondi’ stands charged with assault with intent to commit a felony, vizt rape.
"Assault with intent to commit rape.- This is an attempt to commit rape in which the overt act amounts to an assault upon the woman intended to be ravished. •****. The intent to * have carnal knowledge of the woman assaulted by force and without her consent must exist and concur with the assault. In other words, the man' must intend to overcome any resistance ' by force, actual or constructive,-and penetrate the woman's person. Any less intent will not suffice., ' Once an assault with intent to commit rape is made, it is no defense that the man voluntarily desisted." (LEM., 1928, par.
U9 1, p.179).
"To constitute an assault with intent to rape, there must be, coupled with the required intent, an overt act amounting to an assault upon the female, **«». Generally, the assault may consist of any act tending to an injury, accompanied by circumstances denoting an intent, coupled with a present ability, to use violence against the person, whether there is any battery or not, for in fact there may be an assault with intent to commit rape without any battery. *#**." (52 C.J., sec.42',-pp.1030,1031).
Biondi's participation in the assault on Margaret is established beyond reasonable doubt. The testimony of Koontz (R38), Pope (R43), Lanier -(ll47) and Jones (R50) forms a substantial and reliable body of proof'that it was Biondi who was directly attempting the rape- of the girl. He was on his knees between her outstretched legs as she was held helpless on her back on.thfe ground. The testimony of Dr.'Robert Noel Jones, biologist and bacteriologist, who examined Margaret's knickers and accused Biondi's shorts or trunks, that the stains on these articles of clothing were identical in> nature and contained the same pus cells and bacteria is highly convincing that Biondi had exposed his person in the execution of his nefarious purpose. That he possessed the desire and intent to have sexual intercourse with Margaret is strikingly revealed by his testimony on cross-examination hereinbefore set forth in extenso (R69-72). He was frustrated in his attempt only by the timely interference of Koontz and his fellow soldiers. There was substantial evidence upon which to base the finding of his specific intent to rape Margaret at the time and place alleged. All of the elements of the crime were clearly proved against Biondi and in* the state of the
— 10 —

evidence the court would not have been justified in making any other finding than it did (CM ETO 78, Witts: CM ETO 489, Rhinehart and Fallucco; CM ETO 492, Lewis: CM ETO 595, Sines; CM ETO 678, DlHuosclo).
The fact that Margaret was unable to identify Biondi as one of her assailants (RIO,12,20) or was uncertain as to the identity of the soldier who was on top of her (RIO) or that she fin^llv declared that it was White and not Biondi who occupied .such position (R14) does not in any respect weaken the foregoing conclusion. Confronted with two, and probably three strange soldiers who assaulted and maltreated her viciously and brutally in the obvious attempt to rape her, there is nothing strange or improbable in her confusion and uncertainty. In any event Margaret's testimony insofar as it conflicted with other evidence presented by the prosecution created only an issue of fact which it was the duty of the court to resolve. Inasmuch as there is substantial evidence to support the court’s finding the Board of Review cannot and will not disturb it (CM ETO 106, Orbon: CM ; ETO 492, Lewis: CM ETO.774, Cooper. Jr: CM ETO 799, Booker).
•	The Board of Review is of the opinion that the record is legally
sufficient to support the finding of Biondi’s guilt.
10.	Accused Biondi was 29 years 11 months of age at the time of the commission of the offense. He was inducted at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri on 5 February 1942 for the duration of the war plus six months. Accused White was 19 years 2 months of age on 5 August 1943 and was inducted at
New Bedford, Massachusetts on 13 October 1942 for the duration of the war plus six months. ’
11.	The court was legally constituted and had jurisdiction of accused,
Biondi and of the offense charged against him. No errors injuriously affecting the substantial rights of accused Biondi were committed during the trial, but prejudicial and fatal error was committed as to accused White. The Board of Review is of the opinion that the record is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty, and the sentence as to accused Biondi, but is legally insufficient to support the findings of guilty and the sentence as to accused White.	’

1.	In the case of Private BERT (NI.CE) BIONDI (37133633), 7th Air Depot Group (Repair Squadron) and Private CHARLES H. WHITE (11091322), 33rd Air Depot Group (Repair Squadron), both of Base Air Depot No. 1, VIII Air Force Service Command attention is invited to the foregoing holding of the Board of Review, that the record of trial is legally sufficient to support the findings and the sentence as to the accused Biondi and legally insufficient to support the findings and sentence as to accused White, which holding is hereby approved. Under the provisions of Article of War 5G^> you now have authority to order the execution of the sentence imposed upon accused Biondi. The order should, of course, promulgate the vacation of White's sentence.
2.	.White was before the court upon a Charge and Specification which failed to allege that he committed any crime. In legal Affect he was not tried, and he has therefore never been placed in jeopardy. The evidence is convincing that White is equally guilty with Biondi of the felonious assault upon the young woman. No legal reason, in my opinion, exists against properly charging and trying him for the assault with intent to commit a felony, vizi rape, upon Miss Moores.
3.	When copies of the published order are forwarded to this office,
they should be accompanied by the foregoing holding and.this indorsement. The file number of the record in this pffice is ETO 882. For convenience of reference please place that number in brackets at the end of the ordert (ETO 882).'	'
