5. On the evening of 24 June 1943 at about 10:30 p.m. in a residential section of Station Road in Bamber Bridge, four military policemen attempted to arrest and take into custody two colored soldiers, who were stationed at AAF Station 569 for alleged violation of certain standing orders. The arrest wa3 resisted not only by the two soldiers, but also by a group of colored soldiers who accompanied them and who. were also stationed at AAF Station 569. There arose a serious disturbance during the course of which two of the soldiers, the -accused Ogletree and one Private Lynn M. Adams (34151263), 1949th Quartermaster Truck Co.(Avn), 1511th Quartermaster Truck Regiment (Avn.) were shot and wounded by the policemen'and two of the policemen were injured by rocks and bottle3 thrown by some of the soldiers (R53>54). Reference is made to CM ETO 804, Ogletree et al, supra, for a description of this episode.
At the conclusion of this street fighting Ogletree and Adams were assisted into camp by companions and were taken to the dispensary for treatment (R115,116,177,240,537-541).	After examination and-the
administration of "first aid" by the post medical officers, they were placed in an ambulance as "stretcher cases" and were transferred to the 110th Station Hospital at Warrington (Rn7,129,177,183,331,534-536).
Rifles or carbines were stored in various supply rooms in camp. "The rifles of the 1938th company were kept in a room at the extreme eastern wing of Building H. An rifles of the 1945th company were contained within a store room located in the westerly projecting wing of Building M. The 1958th company stored its rifles in a small room near the center of Building N. In Building C there were separate gun rooms for the 1933rd, 1957th and 1994th companies. The rifles of the 1949th company were in a room in Building J. (Pros.Ex.B). Each gun or supply room was in charge of a supply sergeant, all rifles and carbines of the companies were in the designated storage rooms prior to 10:30 p.m. on

24 June 1943 and each room was locked (11102,207,222,246,611).
A soldier wa3 authorized to possess or use an arm only upon special order or authorization from higher authority (R52,182). On the night' of 24-25 June 1943 no permission had been given to the men to take and possess rifles or carbines (R52,188,195,218,222,248) and no order was issued authorizing any of them to enter the rifle storage rooms, except those charged with the duty of care and preservation of 'the ordnance (R52,182,195). No ammunition had been issued to the troops except to the camp guards, and the only rifles authorized to be in the possession of the men were those rifles issued to sentries - one for each post (R52, ; 415). It was (the duty of the sentry leaving his guard tour to deliver., his rifle and clip of cartridges to the sentry relieving him (R445,449, 450). Ammunition was stored in a special room in the guardhouse (R82, 83,415,450) and also at regimental headquarters (R86). No authority was given to enter the guardhouse ammunition room, except to a small number of officers and men whose duties required them to make such entry.
f
Except on special occasions hereinafter stated no one was authorized to take any of the automotive equipment from the camp (R248, 318).
The main entrance, to the camp leading from Mounsey Road was beared by a gate and there was a sentry posted at the gate (R325,326). Immediately adjacent to the gate on the right-hand side entering camp was a sentry-box or guard-hut.- The guardhouse (containing the ammunition storage room) was situate about fifty feet easterly from the guard hut on the right-hand si<Je of Access Road and about 25 feet back from the street line. On the left-hand side of Access Road immediately adjoining the front line of -the camp was p. parking space for 70 trucks (herein designated "motor pool") which was entered from Access Road (Fros.Ex.B).
•Within' a short period of time after the return to. camp of the two wounded men, Ogletree and Adams, information, as to their injuries and the melee wherein they were Involved apread rapidly among the soldiers (R133,190,235)*	Descriptions of the disorder in tovm became disparted;
and exaggerated. The soldiers became excited and a degree of hysteria swept through the post (R37,133,156,221,222,228,244,316). It is possible to infer from portions of -the evidence-that there were certain noncommissioned officers who were responsible for indirectly inciting and arousing the men (R138,139,141,146,161,179,185,189,261,267,271). There was almost a complete failure on their part to assert authority over their men, and very little or any effort was made by any of-them to prevent the disorders (R138,139,141,149,179,185,189,198) which continued into
the early morning hours of 25 June 1943.

storage or supply rooms were broken into and arms removed therefrom (R60, 85,138,180,189,192,195,200,272). . Soldiers with rifles and carbines made their appearance in and about the barracks and at separate points within the post (R38,47-49,56,58,65,70,78,79,82,129,Ul,1U,H7,157,178,188,181, 190,194,202,211,222,223). There is no evidence as-to the identity of the men who actually broke into the store rooms (including the regimental supply room) although it was clearly proved that-door panels were crushed in and locks broken and smaished (R60,85,$6,1£0,195,211,613).
,At approximately 11:00 p.m, a-group of soldiers collected about-the main entrance gate and in the proximity of the guardhouse. There were 125 to 200 men in this assemblage. About 25 of the men were-armed with rifles; some wore helmets and they-were indiscriminately clad in "Class A" uniforms and fatigues (R37,38,46,51,80,190,141,269,291,304).
The men were in a frenzy of excitement as they gathered at the gate.(37,.
38) fore-shadowing a spirit of active violence, but their conduct (developed) into an exhibition - of passive.disobedience (R38,42,48,72,102, 212,219). The conversation of the men pertained.to the shooting of -Ogletree and Adams and the grievance of the colored soldiers arising out of alleged unfair and persecutory treatment of them by the military police (R77,271-277),	There also arose among them disjointed-and desultory talk
concerning the social and political status, of the negro race in the United States and of‘certain discriminations practiced in the United Kingdom, against colored American soldiers alleged to have been inspired by white American-troops (R138,140,141,157).
Direct and positive orders were given by Major Heris to- junior officers and non-commissioned officers to assemble the men and march them away from the gate but the orders of the junior officers were ignored by the men and not obeyed (R38,42,48). Major Heris also gave orders in a loud voice addressed to the assembled group t° form into organizations-and return to the respective'company areas, but.this order also was not obeyed by the men (R48).
Following the breaking and entering of the gun or supply rooms certain soldiers, acting.without authority.or permission, took possession of government 2^- ton trucks and carry-alls,. Nine or ten of the vehicles came out of the motor pool on to Access Road (R38,48,49) immediately prior to Major Heris’ talk to the men. Major Heris stopped one of the carry-alls containing five soldiers at the gate and they acceded to his demands (R52, 79,80) not.to proceed further. A 2g- ton truck, containing six or seven soldiers armed with rifles, which was being driven in the rear of the carry-all swung around it and crashed through the closed gate. It was being driven at the rate of 25 or 30 miles per hour (R38,49,55,56,64,65,79,88,179, 208,316) and it and its passengers disappeared down Mounsey Road.. The identity of_ the men in the truck was never established during the course of the trial (R49,65,79,179,316).
Following this episode the crowd of soldiers was addressed by Major Heris (R47,58,80,268,270) who urged them to return to their barracks

and company areas and put down their guns informing them that neither.' Colonel Pitcher, the regimental commander, nor himself as second in command knew anything of the situation that had developed in Bamber Bridge. Major Heris further stated to them that until such time as the facts were known their officers wanted them to do nothing that would cause further trouble or in any wise jeopardize or embarrass the relations of the American soldiers with the civilians, and that they would have to believe their officers and allow them to discover the full facts before they proceeded any further (R47,305). Certain subordinate officers likewise repeated the "reouests" of Major Heri3 and attempted to get the men to return to their quarters. The soldiers did not voluntarily respond to this request, but Lieutenant Edwin B. Jones, a colored, officer, by pre-arrangement with Major Heris led the men back from the gate in "sheep-like1* fashion with the representation that he wanted all wha had seen the affair in town to report the facts to him (R43).	1
Simultaneously with the occurrences at the camp gate, information concerning the wounding of Ogletree and Wise reached other soldiers who had remained in and about their barracks. They also collected in company areas, in their recreation or common rooms and in the hall-ways of their barracks (R138,156,178,207,209,222,224,231,605,613,541,700,774).	Conver-
sation and discussion ensued between the men relative; to the fight in Bamber Eridge, and the wounding of the two soldiers. There were no overt acts of violence or disorder evidenced by these particular groups except their assembling and engaging in threatening conversations and the talcing by many of them without authority of rifle3 and carbines from the various company supply rooms (R56,64,138,194*222,228,244).	Some wore helmets and
carried gas masks (R194,6l3). Several of the accused were in these groups and' the only evidence of their misconduct at the time alleged is their unauthorized possession of arms under the above circumstances (R58,65,l38, 141,157,178,202,724,742,768). Company officers -were with these men, and after the passing of several hours, the men voluntarily went to bed. 1
/ / • •
There were other groups of soldiers within the camp, however, wha did engage in acts of violence and disorder. Government automotive equipment - trucks and carry-alls - were taken without -authority from the motor parks and driven about the camp with no proven purpose or object.
Such demonstrations were manifestly the result of loss of disciplinary control over the men (R245,542). In addition to the 2-g- ton truck which crashed through the camp gate, there were other vehicles driven from the camp without authority (R82,105,251,294,295,299,306,685).	Of the accused,
only Fill (R58,70) and Starks (295-7) are connected or implicated in this wrongful use of Government motor vehicles;at the time and place alleged.
From a time commencing about eleven q*clock p.m. 24th of June 1943 and continuing until about four 0*clock a.mi. 25th June 1943 the,

discharge of. fire-arms was heard in and about camp (R59,138,192,195, 244,245,694,708,747,752,753). Some of the shots were fired from within the camp area and Btray and ricochet bullets passed dangerously near officers and men (R117,134,137,143,332,613,6a-,659,665,751,286,287). At . intervals the sound of other shots coming fhom a considerable distance was also heard in camp (R59,180,209,210,244,618), With respect t6 the shooting from both within and without the camp there is not. even a scintilla of • evidence proving that; any of the .accused was responsible for same,
, Within the camp limits unidentified armed soldiers molested,and interferred with the free movements of officers. In several instances officers were halted and denied the right to proceed on their missions (H117,118,129,142,143,166,167,317,318,468,658) and both officers and enlisted men. were menaced with fire-arms (R117,134,137,223,332)• Again the proof fails to show the participation of any of the accused in such misdeeds.
Upon'telephonic request at about 11s00 p.m. 24 June 1943, a detachment of Military Police left- Preston and drove to Bamber Bridge.
The detachment was commanded' by Captain Herman A. Hech and consisted of 12 military policemen (R290,29l). The convoy was composed of an armored • scout-car and two quarter-ton trucks. On the second of the trucks a machine gun had been mounted' (R80,81,249,290-293) • . The military police contingent arrived at the main gate of the camp and Captain Hech conferred with Lieutenants Roller and Sylvester. The military policemen shone flashlights over the camp until such action was stopped by the commander-of the detachment. Captain Hech was requested by Major Heris to take hi3 men and vehicles out of sight of camp and stand by for emergency call. The police detachment drove south on Station Road in the direction of the main part of Bamber Bridge ;(R8l,ia,210,250,251,256,257,212,291).... News of the arrival-of the military police with the armored car and mounted machine-gun spread with electric rapidity through camp, and: it is clearly evident that the purpose of the visit, was magnified and distorted (R199,200,7.00). There were shouts of "The white MPs are here with machine guns" (Ria, 199,200,
2l5); "Here, come the MPs. let's get the rifles'1 (R272); "Get your rifles; they 'are at the gates with machine guns" (R635), and "They are coming in tanks" (R687). The excitement resultant upon news of the shooting of Ogletree and Adams had greatly‘subsided, but following the visit of the military police there was an obvious resurgence of excitement and hysteria (R81,199,200,247,272) and among certain groups there was an exhibition of mob psychology which denoted fear approaching a frenzy (R81,199,200,213).
Men ran through company streets and areas shouting and yelling. Rifle shots from within camp became numerous (hiring the next 10 minutes. The sound of motor vehicles being "warmed up" and motors "racing" filled the air, and several vehicles were driven from the motor parks into the camp roads and some of them were taken from camp (R59,60,80-82,90,101,199,200, .272,317,722). There were but few men with rifles'until the military police made their appearance at the camp gate, but immediately thereafter numerous armed soldiers were visible (R89,90),
Perhaps the most violent act occurring in the campwas committed
-12-

(71)
by 15 to 25 soldiers, who, armed with rifles, rushed the rear door of the guardhouse and entered the room where 1600 rounds of .30 caliber ammunition was stored. a box of ammunition was broken open and cartridges were distributed to the men. Lieutenant Holler discovered the depredation and believed he took possession of all remaining ammunition. However, he overlooked a box. The soldiers returned. They were intercepted by Lieutenant Roller in the act of distributing this box of ammunition. One of the soldiers said to Lieutenant Roller: "I am sorry, Lieutenant, but we just had'to take things into our own hands." There was not a fragment of identification of the soldiers who participated in this indefensible violation of orders and discipline, and not even an inference that any of the accused were involved (R82,83,91,256,257).
6. Colored soldiers of an uncertain number, armed with rifles which had been secured without authority from the company supply rooms and carrying ammunition taken from the regimental supply room and the guardhouse ammunition room, escaped from camp during the darkness. Several were seen climbing over a rear fence of the camp (R601,641,643). These men together with those who rode in the 2-g- ton truck and other vehicles which left" AAF Station 569, formed marauding parties which for several hour3 wandered ab.out the town of- Bamber Bridge and committed acts,of violence. There were several separate incidents proved at the .trial.
Episode 1:	One	group	composed of about twenty men, armed1 with
rifles and clad in either "Class A" uniforms or fatigues reached a point in the southern part of Bamber Bridge near the intersection of the Chorley and Wigan highways. They fired several shots near the home of the civilian witness, Ashcroft, who went to the front d.®0r of his home, ’ One of them warned him: "Get inside there is going to be a war". Some of the men were hiding behind a stone wall while two crouched on the ground. These men went in the direction of Hob Inn and soon thereafter shooting was heard by Ashcroft (R110-112). Some time later another crowd of about 12 soldiers went over the wall which surrounds Ashcroft's place and also went down the road in the direction of Hob Inn. After 12:30 a.nw 25 June 1943 Ashcroft heard more shooting for about an hour (R112). Ashcroft became cautious and his wife nervous.. Neither of these groups of soldiers were identified and it is not proved that any. of the accused were with them (R112).
Episode 2:. The "Queens Hotel" is also located on Station Road in the southern end of Bamber Bridge near Hob Inn. At about 11:15 p.m. Arthur Laidler, the proprietor of the hotel heard shooting and upon going out of doors saw 20 or 30 colored soldiers armed with rifles and running down Chorley Road in the direction of Bamber Bridge. One soldier called to Laidler: "You better get inside, boss, there is going to be plenty of shooting". Another soldier shouted: ."Shoot the bugger."	Two of the men
discharged their rifles and there was spasmodic rifle fire in the distance until two or three a.m. One shot passed over the "Queens Hotel". Laidler and his wife were "very upset" (R107-111). None of these soldiers were

identified
CONFIDENTIAL
Episode 3:	Another group of six colored soldiers were seen about
11s00 p.m. on Station Road at a point opposite the police station which is located north of AAF Station 569 (R104). They were all armed. Two jeeps passed south on Station Road coming from the direction of Preston and they were fired on. Then three more jeeps passed south and they were also fired on. This group of negroes disappeared south on Station Road. Frequent rifle shots coining from Adams Hall Camp were heard by Sergeant Lawrence Constable, County Police Officer of Bamber Bridge who was at the police station, Many civilians came to the police station to seek protective -shelter and remained until 1:30 a.m. 25 June 194-3, because it wa3 unsafe to go'on to the public streets. These people were much disturbed (R103-105}113}295)•	,
Episode 4:	As Edward Brindle proceeded squth on Station Road from the
police station at about 2:40 a.m, 25 June 1943 he. saw four colored soldiers, with rifles, on .a wall near Midland Bank. As he entered the door of his house a bullet struck a half-yard behind him. His wife and daughter were hysterical(R114).	.
■Episode 5:	First Lieutenant Richard J. Dickinson, Detachment B,
234th Military Police Company was stationed at Preston on 24 June 1943. Pursuant tp a call he left Preston with a detachment of military policemen proceeding in three vehicles (R249). Arriving Bamber Bridge' a call was made at AAF Station 569 where Lieutenant Dickinson conferred with a major . (Major Heris) and a captain (Captain Anderson) and upon Major Heris' advice left the proximity of the camp (R38,250,255*256,257), drove into the main part of the town and parked his vehicles. After proceeding south on Station Road for a distance. Lieutenant Dickinson was informed that there were armed soldiers in one of the back streets. Accompanied by Private First Class Howard Miller and Private Lester, of the Military;Police Corps, he went down the back street endeavouring to find the soldiers. Three armed soldiers approached from the north. At that moment Miller saw a truck filled with armed soldiers coming from the opposite direction. Miller and Lester took cover behind a wall and Lieutenant Dickinson ran into a house. He stumbled in the door-way and fell as a bullet passed over his head (R251,25S). Lieutenant Dickinson and his men wore Military.Police brassards (R253,259). According to Miller, Lieutenant Dickinson, he and Lester were riding in the same jeep and two shots were directed at them as they halted (R258). The evidence fails to connect any of the accused with this incident- (R259).
Episode 6:	Connected with the foregoing episode is another one
involving Lieutenants Willis and Huxtable., Major Heris at about 11:00 p.m. ordered the two officers to leave the station, go into town, "round-up" the men and return them to .camp. They drove down Station Road in a jeep. About opposite the "Queens Hotel" public house three colored soldiers dressed in fatigues and armed with rifles stepped into the street. They shouted "halt" and as Lieutenant Willis stopped the car, commenced to shoot. Lieutenant Willis jumped out and ran around the corner into an air-raid warden's house. Lieutenant Huxtable took the wheel and backed the jeep around into a side

street and sought refuge	in a	private home. Shots were	heard a few minutes
later that sounded as	if	they	struck the Military Police	vehicle (R262,263,
269,270). There was no identification of the three colored soldiers.
Episode 7: Warrant Officer Salim Ghazil, of 1513th Battalion,
1511th Quartermaster Truck Regiment (Avn) left Preston at lit00 p.m.
24- June 1943 driving a jeep with two colored soldiers as passengers.
At a point between the railway tracks and Hopwood Street in Bamber Bridge he was given an order	to	halt	and, when he did not obey,	three shots were .
fired. Ke stopped.	An	armed colored soldier being one	of a group of
three or' four soldiers approached the jeep and wanted to know who was in the car. Ghazil told the man sitting next to him to tell the soldier:
"It was Sergeant Ghazil". He was then informed that it was not safe to proceed, but Ghazil drove towards the camp. The armed men rode on the hood and in the back of the car, but when he stopped they dismounted and disappeared. They were not identified (R282-284).	•.	■	>
Episode 8:	Private	First	Class	Edward Smith, a member of the .
234th Military Police Company left Preston about 11:00 p.m. 24 June 1943, driving a Government half-ton Dodge truck. When he re'ached a point between Hopwood and Mounsey streets in Bamber Bridge he heard two shots. Something hit him in the face and the next day two pieces of brass were removed from the left side of his face. Pros.Ex.3 and Pros,Ex.4 are photographs of the truck driven by Smith on this occasion. Sixteen bullet holes are shown in the left front door of the truck and the evidence is clear that they did not exist prior to this incident. The identity of the persons responsible for this shooting was not shown (R286-290).
Episode 9:	Lieutenant	Ousset was Special Services and Post
Exchange Officer at AAF Station #569 on 24 June 1943. During the evening of that day he had been absent from the camp and was returning in a c.ommand can. At about 11:00 p.m. as he turned from Station Road into Llounsey Street he heard a couple of shots. A truck stood cross-wise in the street, and Lieutenant Ousset stopped and parked his car. Some one shouted: "Cut the lights off and the motor". He complied, waited about five minutes and then attempted to drive around the truck. There were further shots and he stopped One shot went through the wind-shield of his car and’ he then received three bullets in his left leg and two in his right leg as he sat in the car. When the shooting ceased a voice called: "Come'out with your hands up". ’ Lieutenant Ousset struggled out of the car and went to the rear of it. There were about 30 men about.~ Some one said: "This'is Lieutenant Ousset". Khen the officer said he was wounded, a soldier came to him, entered the car and took the wheel.	A second soldier assisted Lieutenant Ousset into the vehicle
■They went through the camp gate with permission of the guard, driving first to the officers* quarters ana then to the dispensary(R328-330).	The wounded
man was examined, dressingswere applied and at about 1:45 a.m. 25 June 1943
he was placed in an. ambulance and taken to the 110th General Hospital at
Warrington (R84,332,333). A Red Cross flag was placed on the ambulance in
order to afford protection (R335). The ambulance was stopped in camp by
several armed men as it turned into Access Road, but after explanations were

given it was allowed to proceed (R85,334)• None of the accused except Doakes (who was acquitted) were connected with this incident, and Doakes was apparently the soldier who entered Lieutenant Ousset's car-and drove him to the dispensary (R332,335).
Episode 10:	The	ambulance	which	carried Ogletree-and Adams to
the 110th General Hospital-at Warrington returned to camp early on the morning of 25 June 1943.- When it reached within about 15 yards of the main gate it was challenged and'stopped by a group of about 40 soldiers wearing fatigues and gas-masks and bearing arms. The occupants (Captain Milnanow, Sergeant Walker, Sergeant Bentley and Private Knox) obeyed an order to turn out the lights and dismount. There were wild curses.
Anger and fear were evidenced by the soldiers. Upon giving explanations, the occupants of the ambulance'were allowed to proceed (R117,130,134).
None of the accused were identified'as being in this group of soldiers.
Sergeant-Constable, the County Police Officer, made a survey of damages suffered by individual civilian house-holders as a result of the'
various disturbances in' the town and the same showed:
* • . •
. House at #246 Station Road - bullet penetrated ■ frame work of door;
House at corner of Mounsey Street and Station __ . Road - bullets penetrated upper window 10 feet above floor with breakage of glass and damage to plaster frieze in room;
House at #2 Jackson Street (Corner of Mounsey’
Street)- Three bullet holes in window seven feet from floor and one hole within foot from floor,
(R105-106).
7.	It is necessary to consider certain motions made by the defense and rulings on evidentiary questions during the course of the trial:
' (a). A motion for continuance was'made on behalf of accused Ogletree and Wise which was denied (Rll-14). The motion was made after -arraignment but before pleas were received which was proper (MCM,, 1928, par.52cj, p.4l)» The bases of the motions were (l) that Captain Thomas L. Ho£an, individual counsel for the two named accused, had been'retained less than three days prior to commencement of•the trial'on 3 Sept 1943,
• although the charges had been served on said accused on 24 August 1943, and (2) that the two accused had been tried and convicted on charges which would, sustain a plea of former jeopardy in the instant, case.:	Insufficient
time to enable counsel to prepare for trial is a ground for a continuance. However, the refusal of the court to grant a continuance does not nullify the'trial, although it may be grounds for a rehearing (MCM., 1928, par,52^, pp.40-41).	The two accused were served with the charges ten days prior to
trial. The regularly appointed defense counsel and his assistants were engaged in the preparation of the defense during this period and .their services were available to these accused. The selection by the two accused of Captain Hogan as individual counsel occurred a week after they were informed of the nature of the charges against tht m and of their prospective
16 -
CONFIDENTIAL
(75)
trial. The granting or denying of a motion for continuance is within the sound judicial’ discretion of the court and its action in denying a motion for continuance will not be disturbed upon appellate review in the absence of a showing of abuse of that discretion (CM 126974 (1919), CM 135095 (1919), Dig.Ops.JAG., 1912-1940, par,377, p.187).
The record of trial reveals that the two accused were defended with skill and diligence and such effort resulted in their acquittal of the serious charge of mutiny. Under the circumstances the Board of Review is unable to discover anything arbitrary or capricious on the part of the court in denying the notion for continuance on ther ground that counsel did not have stifficlent time to. prepare .for trial. There was a proper exercise of its judicial discretion (CM 228507.(1943), Bui.
JAG., Lay 1943, Vol.II, Ho.5, par.377, p.183).
The further contention of the two accused was that they had been tried and convicted of offenses in which “the sentences had not been acted on by the reviewing authorities on date of commencement of trial of the instant case, and that therefore they were entitled to a continuance until such time as the sentences in the first case became final, in order to enable them to assert such sentence in the instant case in support of pleas of former jeopardy. By stipulation', part of the charge and specifications in the first case was read into the record. A person cannot without his consent be tried a second time for the same offense;
"*** but no proceeding in which an accused has been found guilty by a court-martial upon any charge or specification shall be held to be a trial *** until the reviewing *** authority shall have taken final action upon the case." (AW 40; L5CM 1928., par.68,
P-53)-	‘
The rule of law governing this situation is stated as follows;
"Where accused has been convicted of a certain offense and an appeal has been taken, a trial against him, under the same statute, on the same state'of facts, and on the ground of the case already pending in the appellate court, -and involving the same questions, should be continued until the determination of the former case in the appellate court. However, the mere fact that accused has been convicted of another offense and'is at the time'awaiting sentence or determination of an appeal is not ground for a continuance on a charge of an entirely different offense." (22 CJS., sec.501d, p.797).
- 17 -

wfidential
"Accused, pending his appeal from a » conviction'of violating a statute, is not entitled to a stay of proceedings against'-him on other charges for violations of the same statute (State v. Rose, 50 So.
520, 1241a. 526)". (22 CJS., sec.501£, footnote 85, p.797).
The former case to which individual defense.counsel made reference in his motion for continuance‘and with respect to which part of the charges and specifications were placed in evidence is CIS ETO 804, Ogletree, Nunn, Adam3 and Wise decided by the Board of Review and approved by the Assistant Judge Advocate General on 6 November 1943. While'it is true that Ogletree and Wise (who were two of the accused in the former case) were in both the former and in the instant case charged with violation of Articles of War 89 and 96, a comparison of the specifications laid under said Articles of War in the former case with the specifications laid under the same articles in the instant case, reveals without doubt that the specifications involved in the instant case describes acts of misconduct separate and distinct from the offenses alleged’in the former case. A plea of former jeopardy could not have been sustained. As a consequence the hocused were not entitled for the reason stated to a stay of proceedings in the instant case. The court committed no error in denying the motion for continuance.
(b) On behalf of accused Roach and James A. Williams, a motion for severance and separate trials, was made after arraignment and before receiving their pleas. The motion was denied (R14-16). The grounds for the motion were? (l) prejudice accruing to the rights of the two movants because of evidence which would be introduced against the other accused and (2) that the defense of the other accused would be prejudicial to the rights of the movants.
A similar motion made on behalf of accused Doakes, Patterson and Walter Johnson, was denied.. The grounds for the motion were the same as in the Roach and Williams motion (R15-17).
Likewise a motion for severance was made on behalf of accused Ogletree and Wise, which was denied. This motion was also on the grounds stated in the Roach and Williams motion (R18-19). Thereafter the motion was renewed on the ground that the defense intended to Cali co-accused as defense witnesses., . The motion was also denied (R238).
The regularly appointed defense counsel, representing 28 of the accused other than the seven represented by individual counsel, also moved for separate trials for his clients on the following basis:	The accused
were members of the following 'groups: 'six were members of the -1958th company, eight were members of the 1945th company, six were members of the 1949th company, ten were members of the 1933rd company and five were members of the 1994th company. , The motion proposed severance of trials in such manner that no member of a given company should be tried jointly with another
- 18 -
CONFIDENTIAL
(77)
member of the same company. The reason for such procedure was asserted to be the probability of an accused calling as his witnesses co-accused who were members of his own company and the severances were required so as to compel such co-accused to become witnesses; In further explanation of the motion the court's attention was invited to the fact that each company lived in its own set of barracks on the 24 June 194-3 and each company' 'barracks were separated from those of other companies by a considerable distance (Pros.Ex.l).	Cpnsequently in many cases the most reliable
and valuable witnesses for an accused would be the.feU.ow members of his company. The motion was denied (R19-21).	.
V/ith respect to severance of trials of accused jointly charged with an offense the Manual for Courts-Martial directs*
•i x x x x k x a motion to sever is a potion by one of two or more joint accused to be tried separately, from the other or others., It will regularly be made at the arraignment.
The motion should be granted if good cause is shown; but. in cases where the essence of the offense is combination between the parties - conspiracy, for instance - the court may properly be more exacting than in other cases with respect to the question whether the facts shown in support of the motion constitute a good cause. The. more common grounds of this motion are that the mover desires to avail himself on his trial of the testimony .of one or more of his coaccused, or of the testimony of the wife of one; or that a . defense of the other accused is antagonistic to his own; or that the evidence as to them will in some manner prejudice his defense. (Winthrop) ". (L3CM 1923, par.
71b, p.55).
The foregoing quotation should be considered against the background of judicial principles applicable, in connection with motions for severance of trials of jointly charged accused.

"The question *** is this, whether two or more persons, jointly charged in the sane indictment with a capital offense, have a right, by the laws of the country, to be tried severally, separately and apart, the counsel for the United States objecting thereto, or whether it is a matter to be allowed in the discretion of the court, x*»*. In our opinion, it is a matter of sound discretion, to be exercised by the court with all due regard and .tenderness to prisoners, according to the known humanity of our criminal jurisprudence," (United States v, Marchant & Colson, 12 Wheat,'480-435; 6 L.Ed., 700,702).
"These two defendants moved that they be tried separately from Hillard F, Ball* because he had been previously acquitted; because the government relied on his acts and declarations made after' the killing and not in their presence or hearing; and because he was ja material witness in their behalf. , But the question whether defendants jointly indicted should be tried together or separately was a question resting in the sound discretion of the court below. ***. It does not appear that there was any abuse of that discretion in ordering the three defendants to be tried together ***.« (Ball,Ball and Boutwell v.

"That it was within the discretion of the court to order the defendants to be tried together there can be no question, and the practice is too well established to require further consideration." (S^ilson v. United States, 250 U.S. 583, 585-586, 63 L.Ed., . .1154,1156).

(23 CJS., sec.933a, pp,217-218),
The accused were charged jointly with joining in a mutiny, rioting and wrongfully possessing and using .government property. Each offense charged, was of the nature which may be committed by two or more persons. Therefore a joint charge, was entirely proper. The record of trial reveals that care and caution were exercised both by the law member and trial judge advocate in the presentation and receiving of the statements of certain accused. The court was strictly enjoined that a statement should be considered only as evidence against the accused making same (R39&-397)* (Johnson v. United States, 82 Fed,(2nd) 500, Certiorari denied 29,8 U.S. 688, 80 L.Ed, li|07). The primary ground of the motions, vizi the necessity of securing testimony o,f certain co-accused becomes idle in the face of the fact that twenty-three of the thirty-five accused appeared as witnesses and each testified at length and was subjected to plenary cross-examination. Considering the record of tjrial. as a whole and the peculiar nature of the offenses charged the Board of Review concludes that the court did not proceed arbitrarily or capriciously in denying the several motions for separate trials, (Olmstead v. United States, 19 Fed.(2nd) 842, 53 ALR.1472j Certiorari denied 275 U.S. 557, 72 L,Ed.424)» It exercised a sound judicial discretion and its decisions will not be disturbed on appellate review (CnI 144367 (1921)j Dig,

(c) On behalf of each and all accused a motion was made to strike Charges II and III and their respective specifications for the reason that they were duplications of Charge I and its specifications and therefore multifarious (R21,22). The motion was denied (R26), The argument of the

However* there are times when sufficient doubt as , to tli®, facta or law exists to warrant making one transaction the basis for. charging two or more offenses." (MCM 1928, par.

An analysis of the charges against accused shows that four distinct offensee are allegedt

Four separate and distinct offenses are therefore joined. While such form of pleading is condemned by a majority of civil courts, before military courts such practice is permissible and has long been recognised.
«****«^ Unlike the ordinary criminal procedure, where but one indictment, setting forth (in one or more counts) a single offence or connected criminal transaction, is, in general brought to trial at one time, the military usage and procedure permits of an indefinite number of.offences being charged and adjudicated together, in one and the same proceeding.

to the summary and final action so important in military cases.-wherever an officer or soldier hah been appa-1 rently guilty of several or many' offencesI whether of a similar character or distinct in their nature,
’ charges and specifications covering them all, should, if practicable, be preferred together and together brought to trial; separate sets of charges, where they exist, being consolidated, •***, (Winthrop's Military Law & Precedents, Reprint,
P.152).
Joining in a mutiny and committing a riot are separate and distinct offenses, A mutiny in military law is a revolt by two or more soldiers with or without armed resistance aghinst the authority of their commanding officers (5'C.J., sec.l68, p.352, footnote 2; CM 116735, CM 122535 (I918), Dig, Ops. J.A.G, 1912-1940* par*424 p,288), and the offense of joining in a mutiny requires the performance of*an*overt act of insubordination by the person accused (MCM,, I928, par,136b, p,151). Committing a riot is the joining in a tumultuous disturbance of the peace by three.or more persons acting with a common intent either in executing a lawful private enterprise ~ in a violent and turbulent manner to the terror of the people or in executing an unlawful enterprise in a violent and turbulent manner (54 C.J,, sec.l, p„828j MCM,, 1928, par,147c. pp,l6l,l62). Proof of the facts constituting the offense alleged under Charge III and'its Specification (violation of 96th Article of War) would not in and of themselves, prove either the charge . of joining in a mutiny or committing a riot, ' The latter offenses obviously contain elements not embraced in the charge under the general article, and conviction of the commission of both or either of said offenses would not be inconsistent with a finding of not guilty under the 98th Article of War,
The accused may be found guilty of all the offenses charged without being placed in jeopardy for the same offense (CM 230222 (1943)* BUL.T JAG. .March 1943. Vol.il, N0.3, par,395(44). P.96),
a
Where the conduct of accused‘as alleged in a Specification constitutes the violation of more than one article of war, the pleader may lay the same under separate charges without subjectlng the pleading to the criticism of multifariousness or duplicity. In fact, such practice is dictated by common prudence,
■In military cases where the offence falls apparently equally within the pUrvieW of two or more articles of < war, or where the legal character * of the act of the accused cannot be precisely known or defined till developed by the proof, it is not

unfrequent in cases of'importance to state the accusation under two or more Charges ***■• (Winthrop's Military Law & Precedents, Reprint,
P«H3)«
In the instant case the charges were drafted in accordance with this practice and are therefore free from the defects relied upon by defense counsel. In any event the granting or denying of the motion was a matter wholly with the judicial discretion of the‘court and ihe Board of Review can find in the denial of the motion by the court no such arbitrary action as would justify it in disturbing the court's ruling (Winthrop's Military Law & Precedents, Reprint, p.251)«
.*	(d)’On behalf of each hnd ‘all 'accused motions were made sep-
arately to strike Specifications 1 and 2 of Charge I and also the respective specifications of Charges II and III on the ground that "the allegations contained therein do not specifically allege the time, place and specific acts as to each accused so as to sufficiently advise each accused of the offense that is charged against them* (R26). In support of this motion it was argued by defense counsel that accused were charged "with numerous acts over a period of two days and a large vicinity in the area of Station 5&9 which is certainly; unfair, for these defendants to have to meet a blanket allegation ih a trial where there are 35 different defendants involved*(R26).	‘	*’	*	*
It is exceedingly doubtful that the motions to!strike the specifications wejfc procedurally proper inasmuch as their bases were alleged defects in foxm of the specificatidns rather'than defects in substance (Winthrop's Military Law and Itecedents, Reprint, p,252), However, it will be assumed that the'motion^ performed'the functidns of a motion to make more definite and.certain, or'df a Special'demdrrer (were Such pleadings known in courts-1 martial practice) (31 C.J., seo.404, pp.819,820),
With respect to the specifications of Charges I and II the motions are premised on the assumption that it is necessary to allege as to each accused his particular conduct which constitutes joining in a mutiny (Charge I) and committing a riot (Charge H)« £>uch a contention entirely ignores' the true nature of the offenses, '	1
a	.	.	:	'	•	.	*	....
The gravamen of the offense of joining in a mutiny isi (1) there was a mutiny at.a specific time and place begun against constituted authority and (2) accused joined i'n it. Both specifications of Charge I are complete in this regard. The parts of the two specifications which set forth the means and methods pursued by the accused in "joining in the mutiny" are but descriptive and taken alone would not have constituted a mutiny (CM 125432 (1919)* Dig.Ops.JAG,, 1912-1940, sec.424* pp,288,289), Each accused was entitled to be informed as to where, when and against whom there was a mutiny and that he was charged with having'joined in it. With such information he could prepare his defense or if necessity arose identify

the offense as a basis for a plea of former jeopardy. Beyond that he was not entitled to be informed. Allegations describing generally the conduct of:the several accused renders the charge of joining in a mutiny complete and intelligible, but allegations particularizing the actions of each accused are not necessary and are not part of the gravamen of the charge.	'

I	I	.
The constituent elements of the offense of rioting arej (1) an unlawful assembly consisting of three or more persons; (2) an intent mutually to assist against lawful authority and (3) acts of violence (MCM., 1928, par.146^1 5k C.J., aec.3» P«83°l 2 Wharton's Criminal Law -12th Edition - sec.1869). A specification alleging-these three elements states facts constituting the offense. Allegations1 describing the acts of violence committed are essential averments inasmuch as it is from them that terror of the populace is inferred, but they may be general allegations (2 Wharton's Criminal Law - 12th Edition - sec.1869, p.2199). It -is unnecessary to set forth the particularized acts of each rioter and if the same are contained therein they are- descriptive merely (Commonwealth
of Massachusetts v.- irishman1. Mass.1____*, 126. NE 828-,'9 ALR. 549 )• The
Specification of Charge II meets all of these requirements and fully
informed accused as to the exact nature of the charge against them.
*■
As directed to Charge III and its Specification the motions are wholly devoid of merit. The accused are charged jointly with wrongfully and illegally seizing arms and ammunition, wrongfully and illegally taking and using Government vehicles, damaging and destroying Government property and other aots of violence and disorder constituting serious breaches of discipline and of the peace. ! These allegations clearly charge an offense under the 96th Article of War (Winthrop's Military Law & Precedents, Reprint, p.732)» With respect to the form of allegations charging a joint offense there is no requirement that averments shall be included alleging that the-accused acted severally, nor -
■After a joint charge, counts containing individual1 charges- need not be inserted, and if inserted, they may be rejected as . surplusage to prevent the indictment from being regarded as containing a misjoinder.
***• If the offense may have been committ«» ed by one of defendants singly, it is held that it.is not necessary to allege which of them cosmitted the- actual criminal act, that the correctness of the allegation, if made, is not material1, and that the particular acts constituting the charge against each defendant need not be sev--erally set out ***,• (31 C.J., sec.287,

It is manifest that the court committed no error in denying the motions.

Both accused were charged with joining in a mutiny and rioting (Charge I and II)* Davis and Patterson were non-commissioned officers.

an adjacent yard during periods when court was closed or in recess, they were, seen throu^i a window of the lounge by certain of the witnesses who were awaiting their calls to testify and that certain other persons in the lounge had identified particular accused for .the benefit of these prospective witnesses (R278)* , Defense counsel further asserted that, the ri^its of accused had been prejudiced by this conduct, and asked that the practice cease* He did not n»ve for a mis-trial (R279), The president directed the trial judge .advocate /to prevent a reoccurence of such incidents and stated that accused would be given the opportunity of recalling for examination such prior witnesses a3 they believed had been influenced on the question of identity by the means stated (R280)* The claim of prejudice was based on such incidents as were observed personally by defense counsel and no other evidence was offered in proof of same.
One of the critical issues in the case was the identification of the soldiers who were participants in the disorder and violence* Consequently, evidence of the coaching of witnesses so as to assist them to effect identification would be admissible as bearing on the issue of the credibility of these coached witnesses (70 C.J., sec«9l6, p,76o). The record of trial reveals the fact that Captain Anderson (R413)• and Lieutenant Hyland (R73°*731*732» 734) were witnesses for the defence and were exemjined at length as to identifications theretofore made by them. Captain Milnamow (R477)* Lieutenant Sylvester (R526), Captain Gerardot (R623), Lieutenant Arcurl (R629), Lieutenant Ryland (R725), Lieutenant Huxtable (R7&4) 811 <1 Lieutenant Saniter (R766) re-appeared on the stand as defense witnesses and there was no examination of them as to the alleged "coaching" incidents* When Lieutenant Huxtable (R281) was examined as a prosecution’s witness he denied any of the accused had been pointed out.to him. ( Major Heris, Lieutenant Gibson and Major Mattia, as defense witnesses, denied they had "pointed out* any of accused (R415*417*419)•
The "coaching" of witnesses in the manner asserted by defense counsel is not to be condoned. However, the action of the president in directing the trial judge advocate to take action which would prevent a reoccurrence of sane, and the.oppc^rtunity,afforded the defense to cross# examine all of prosecution’s witnesses who had previously testified on the question of identity, removed any prejudice to rights of accused which may have accrued* The subsequent conduct of the defense fully supports this conclusion*
(j)	The objections (R288,289) to the admission in evidence of Pros.Ex.3 and Pros.Rx*4 (photographs of bullet riven truck) were without foundation* The requirements^of proof of authenticity and genuineness were fully met (MCM,, 1928, sec.ll8ib, p.122)*

Wm. O. Starks* Pros.Ex.il (R38O-386) were admitted in evidence after vigorous objection in each instance by ,the defense on 4he grounds that as to each acqused they,were not yolunt^ryj that the person securing, the statements had secured an admission from the respective accused as to their identity and serial number without prior warning of their right to remain silent (aQd the penally foi^ speaking) and that they irere obtained ujjder false pretenses. Each of the statements are admissions and not,confession^. .
•A confession is an admission of the criminal act itself, not an admission of a fact or circumstance ■ from vidch guilt may be inferred.* (20 Am.Jur.
Evidence, bec.478, p.417).
"An admission has been defined as a statement of a party inconsistent with his claim in nn action,and amounting therefore to proof against (20 Am.Jur.Evidence,sec.543»P»460).
’ >
•An admission merely admits some fact which connects or tends to connect fhe defendant with the offense but not with all the t elements of the crime." (State vi Masato Karumai, 126 Pac.(2nd),
1047,1052).
f 1 )	M	i	k	V
"A confession is defined as an acknowledgment of guilt of the crime charged or of the facts which constitute the crimej but it is an admission and not a confession if the facts acknowledged raise an inference of guilt only when considered with other facts." (Underhill's Criminal Evidence, sec.265, PP«5°7*-508).
While each of "the statements admit incriminating facts none of them admit legal guilt (CM 141755 (1920), Dig.Ops.JAG., 1912-1940, sec.395 (10), p.2Q5l CM ETO 292 Mickles). They were therefore admissible in evidence regardless of their voluntary nature(MCM., I928, par.114b, p.H7j CM ETO 804, Ogletree et al). Although both Askew and Keegan, the operatives of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Provost Marshal General's Office were not over scrupulous in their explanations of their purposes

in interviewing accused and exhibited a degree of sharp practice in theirmethods in obtaining the statements (R345»351*353»384»370,372,373)j such facts alone would not bar their admission in evidence (Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438* 72 L, Ed., 944, 951| McIntosh v.
State of Nebraska, 180 N.W. 573, 12 ALE. 798,804). The statements were properly admitted.
(l)	Sergeant Michael P. Keegan of the Criminal Investigation Division, Provost Marshal General's Office, testified that accused Bernard Terrell orally admitted that he obtained his own rifle from the supply room and asserted he had returned it. He refused to sign a statement (R386,394), .* Keegan*informed this accused that he was primarily concerned with recovering the rifles, but gave him the regular warning under the 24th Article of War as to his rights to remain silent. Defense's objection to the testimony was without merit (See par.Tk, supra).
(m)	Accused Purcelle T. Johnson testified that he had talked to lieutenant Ryland while-he (Johnson)-was in the guardhouse about two months subsequent to the date of the alleged offenses. Upon objection of prosecution he was prevented from repeating Lieutenant Ryland's statements to him at that time (R662). The ruling was correct, as such evidence would have been hearsay. Considered as an attempt to impeach prior testimony of Lieutenant Ryland, no proper foundation had been laid in his cross-examination (MCM., 1928, par,124b, p.133).
(n)	Upon request of the trial judge advocate, the law member instructed the court that each written and oral statement of certain accused (James E« Johnson, Jones R. Williams, -Edward R. Williams, Prelot, Roach, Smith, Terrell and Starks) which had been admitted in evidence was evidence only against the' accused making the statement and must not be considered as evidence against any other of the accused (R396»397), This was proper practice in this case. The statements themselves were devoid of incrimination of other accused and were simple in fozm. They could not possible form a "matrix of hearsay evidence" as was condemned by the Board of Review in CM ETO 134, Stump et al. (Cfi Anderson et al v. United States, 63 Sup.Ct.Rep. 599,802). *In instances where the statements are simple or names of co-accused either do not appear or are deleted, the practice followed in this instance fully protects the rights of accused (CM ETO 804, Qgletree et al{ Johnson v. United States, supra).

Defense counsel and individual counsel at the conclusion of prosecution's case in chief moved for findings of not guilty (R397.402, 403,405,407,409), The motions were not renewed at the conclusion of the case. Any errors committed in denying the motions were therefore waived because of the' failure of counsel to renew the motions and will not be ’
considered on appellate review '(CM ETO 5^4, Seville).

Captain Latham was inspecting barracks of 1933rd pompany between 11:00 p.in. and 12 midnight on 24 June 1943* Heard rifle bolt click and went into a room and saw"Grigg with a rifle. Captain Latham told" him not to be foolish, to stay out of trouble and to put rifle down. Grigg put rifle down, turned out lights and went outside. Captain Latham locked door (R245-247).
Accused made an unsworn statement to the"effect that when he heard shouts of "Get your rifle" he went to supply room and took hi3 rifle and then returned to his rooiji. About half an hour later he went to common room and remained there until Lieutenant Ryland advised everybody.to.gp to bed. Accused obeyed and went to bed (R724,725).

The Specification of Charge III alleges that the accused violated the 96th Article of War in ten separate and distinct ways any one of which would have sustained h conviction. With respect to the fifteen accused whose

convictions are now subject to review, considerations need only be given to the allegations that they did (l) seize arms and ammunition by breaking into store rooms and (2) bear arms. There is no proof of any kind or nature that they or either of them were guilty of acts alleged in the re- * mainder of the specification.
The form of the Specification is not subject to criticism on the
ground, of duplicity. . '	’	..	.	*	,

ttAn indictment or count in which two or more separate and distinct offences, whether of the same or a different,nature, are set forth together, is said to be double, and such a -pleading is bad on account of duplicity.1
This rule, however, does not apply to the stating'together, in the same count, of several distinct criminal acts, provided the’same . all form parts of the same transaction, and substantially complete a single occasion of offence. Thus it has been held that assault and.battery and false imprisonment, when committed together or in immediate sequence, may be laid in the same count without duplicity, since Collectively they constitute but one offence.1 So it is.held*not double pleading to allege in the same count the larceny of • several distinct articles appropriated, at the same time and place.
A further description of cases is to 'be noted as not within the rule, or as constitut-' - ing an exception to the rule,- viz., cases of statutory offences or phases of offence of the same nature, classified in the enactment as of the same species*and made similarly punishable.
In a case of this class it was observed by a U, S. court that the several criminal acts indicated may be regarded as 'representing each • a stage in the same offence, and therefore properly to be coupled in one count."'
(Winthrop's Military Law & Precedents, Reprint, pp.14-3-144.)
"Where a single offense may be-committed by several means or in several ways, it may be , charged in a single count to have been so committed, if the ways' or means are not repugnant; but a count cannot be sustained if the means alleged are inconsistent	(31	C.J.,
sec.324., pp.763-764).

The ways and means alleged in the Specification are not in any degree repugnant, contradictory cfr inconsistent. Due to the difficulties involved in charging and trying such a large group .of men “the form of pleading used in this case was proper (CM 153268 (1922), CM 192530 (1930)j Dig.Ops.JAG.,1912-40, sec.428(14), p.298).
It will be noted that the accused wero charged with committing the acts "jointly and in pursuance of a common intent".' While the act of each accused in securing or bearing a fire-arm was an individual act the evidence is Highly convincing that such acts were the result of a common motive and common purpose. It fully sustains the charge of joint action with a common intent.	•	1
The evidence is uncontradicted that on the night of 24.-25 June 1943, all rifles and carbines of the military units stationed at AAF Station #569, except those issued to guards and sentries on duty were stored in company supply rooms. The ammunition was stored in a room in the guard-house and at regimental headquarters. None ofthe accused were authorized either specifically or as members of a command to take or procure fire-arms or ammunition. Under such circumstances their seizure was wrongful and illegal and the taking of them constituted-an offense -under the 96th Article of War as a disorder and neglect "to the prejudice of good order ‘and military discipline"'. Likewise the bearing of arms at times when same is unauthorized or prohibited is a similar offense.
. “‘All disorders and neglects.' In this com- -prehensiveiterm are included all such insubordination} disrespectful or insulting• language or behavior towards superiors or ’ inferiors in rank} violence} »***'turbulent, wantonj mutinous, or irregular conduct} violation of standing orders, regulations, or instructions} **** in fine all such '.sins of commission or omission,' on.the part of either of officers or soldiers as, on the one hand, do not fall within the category, of the 'crimes' previously designated, and, on the.other.hand, are not expressly made punishable in any.other ('foregoing') specific Articles of the code, while vet being clearly prejudicial to good order and military discipline." (Winthrop's Military Law & Prcedents,
. Eepfint, p.722) (Underscoring supplied).
(a)	With respect to the findings of guilty of the accused Frelot, Engram, Roach, Smith.and.Terrell there is substantial competent evidence that each of the accused without authorization of any kind entered company . • gun or supply rooms and seized a rifle-or carbine and thereafter carried the same wrongfully and without authority for some part of the time during which there was disturbance and violence in the camp and in contiguous' areas. The evidence, however, as to each accused, fails to establish the

(95)

fact that the seizure was effected "by breaking into the store rooms." Oppositely it shows that each of these accused entered the store rooms after they had been broken into and secured a rifle or carbine. There was no element of force involved in their entries;’ hence there- was no "breaking" within the technical and generally recognized meaning of the -word (W. & P., Perm, p.775). However, the gist of the offense was the wrongful and unauthorized seizure and bearing of‘arms. The allegation "by breaking into store rooms" was surplusage and an unnecessary averment. It is merely descriptive. It could have been eliminated entirely without affecting the gravamen of the offenses Hence, failure of proof to , support such averment may be wholly disregarded (31 C.J., sec.455, pp.837, 838). - - * •
I *	„	’
(b)	The findings* of guilt against accused Edward R* Williams, Saffo, Flagg, Kirksey, Horton, Arbuckle, Avery, Kendall, Wise and Grigg are supportable upon entirely different evidentiary foundations. There is no proof that any of- the named accused entered a supply or gun storage room and seized a rifle or carbine, nor are there any facts upon which legitimate inferences of such conduct may be based.
It may be- assumed as a general proposition that proof of mere possession of a rifle or carbine is not sufficient to establish that accused's possession was wrongful and unlawful. It may further be assumed that if the only relevant evidence as to the conduct of the above named ten accused is that particularly summarized immediately above, it would be insufficient to establish that the possession by each accused of a rifle or carbine sometime during the night of 24-25 June 1943 was wrongful and
unlawful under the,96th Article-of War.
’ . > . . . \
There Can be no question as to the seriousness or extent of the disorders and violence prevailing at AAF Station #569 and the adjacent community at the time 'these accused were found in possession of rifles and carbines. Neither is there any doubt that-the supply rooms where arms were ordinarily stored had been wrongfully and forcibly broken into and rifles and carbines removed therefrom without authority, and that the firearms which were later in possession of accused were some of the rifles and carbines which had been wrongfully taken from the supply rooms. At approximately the same time, the ammunition storage, rooms in camp had been forcibly entered and ammunition- stolen therefrom. There is no proof that any* of these ten soldiers committed"these unlawful and disorderly.acts. , However, the proof is abundant that each of them was fully cognizant of the turbulent, riotous conditions then prevailing. It is fair to impute to them the knowledge that'other of their fellow.soldiers had not only wrongfully secured possession of anas and ammunition but were also using the same promiscuously, dangerously and unlawfully^ that Government motor vehicles had been or were being seized and used without authority and that there were assemblies of soldiers in the eamp engaged in excitgd and emotional argument and discussion. It is also fair to charge them with knowledge that the rifles "found" by them were part of the rifles which had been removed from the supply rooms without authority.

These accused have been acquitted of charges of joining in a mutiny and committing riot. The situation under consideration is identical-with-one which would have existed had these accused been charged only with wrongful and unlawful possession of fire-arms. It is manifest that the defense early in the trial anticipated this legal issue when it moved to strike the part of lieutenant Roller’s testimony pertaining generally to disturbed and ritous conditions of the camp (R87). The motion was denied and in the opinion of the Board of Review the ruling was proper at the stage at which it was made. Had it been renewed at the conclusion of the prosecution’s case in chief it. should also have been -denied. Notwithstanding the acquittal of these accused of charges of joining in a mutiny and rioting, the causes and circumstances under which they came into possession of the fire-arms are certainly relevant and material facts bearing directly upon the issue, of the wrongfulness and illegality of their possession.
"The general rule is well settled that all evidence must'be relevant. If evidence is relevant upon the general issue of guilt, or innocence, no valid reason exists for . its rejection merely because it may prove, or may tend to prove, that the accused Committed some other -crime, or may establish • some collateral" and unrelated fact. Evidence of other acts to be .available must have some logical connection and reveal evidence of ' knowledge, design, plan, scheme, or conspiracy of the crime charged ■***" (Underhill’s Criminal Evidence, 4-th Ed., sec.184, pp.333--	-335). ■
The following decisions are interesting examples of the application of the foregoing rule to circumstances similar to those of the instant easel Moore v. United States, 150 U.S. 57, 37 L.Ed., 996; Jackson v. United Stated, 102 Fed. 473, 5 C.J«,p,780, footnote 67;Smith v. State, 123 Alabama 64, <26 Southern 641,- 5 C.J., p.780, footnote 67; State v.

The possession of fire-arms by the ten accused soldiers when considered against the background of.this larger scene assumes an entirely different aspect than that suggested by the specific evidence (summarized * above) against each of them when considered alone. The accused did not "find” the rifles and carbines in and about the barracks and in the company areas as they went about routine military duties during the ordinary tranquility and orderliness of a well disciplined camp. The fire-arms "found" by;them had not been mislaid, or carelessly left behind by others and then picked up by accused and returned - to the storage rooms. .. If such were the facts there would be.most Berious doubts as to the guilt of these accused.

These accused acquired possession of the rifles and carbines during a tumultuous disturbance and agitation in camp characterized by open violation of rules, orders and regulations, the discharge of firearms endangering life and limb, the seizure and unauthorized use of Government property, and assembly of personnel, emotional and sensitive to canards and rumours', in groups more nearly, resembling mobs than military organizations. Discipline and control by superior officers had. deterior-. ated to the point where it had largely been replaced with argument and persuasions addressed not to soldiers, but to frightened, angry men. The situation was highly explosive and manifestly it possessed the potentialities of a. large scale mutiny and rioting with promise of tragic and disastrous consequences. The possession of lethal weapons, even for short periods of time under such circumstances and conditions, cannot be treated as casual, harmless episodes. Under the circumstances a .soldier possessed a rifle or carbine at his peril. This conclusion is neither harsfr nor arbitrary; it is dictated by prudence and common sense.
It was within-the particular province of the court to consider the actions and conduct of each accused with, respect to his possession of fire-arms in the light of the entire circumstances as shown .by the evidence. The denials of certain accused that they were in possession of rifles at the time and place alleged produced issues of fact. The explanations offered by other accused in instances where possession of fire-arms was admitted were in the nature of confessions and avoidance of the chapge.
Their exculpatory value as against culpatory evidence resulted also in factual issues. ..	.	•	.
The weighing of the evidence and determining its sufficiency, the judging of credibility of witnesses, the resolving of conflicts in the -evidence and the determination of the ultimate facts were functions committed to the court as a fact-finding tribunal. Its conclusions are final and conclusively binding on the Board of Review where the same are supported by substantial competent evidence (CM ETO 106, Orbon: CM ETO 132, Kelly and Hyde: CM ETO 397, Shaffer: CM ETO 422, Green: CM ETO 492, lewis: CM ETO 804, Ogletree et al).

Captain Anderson saw Patterson in group of soldiers at the main gate.
He was excited and emotional as he asked for permission to go to town to see the wounded men(R61). His attitude might have had a bad effect • on other, men. Captain Anderson told him to calm his men down and return them to .barracks, but did not know whether Patterson complied (R68).
lieutenant Roller heard Patterson very excitedly say he was . determined to leave post. About 50 men were present. Several men got him by the arm and held him (R77) . but he was struggling toward the gate (R99). Lieutenant Sylvester tried unsuccessfully to calm Patterson who was insistent upon leaving camp because two of the men had been shot (R77,96).

He saw Patterson for a few seconds. Patterson volunteered the statement: "Sir, the men are out of control" (R767). He. gave Patterson no orders or instructions as to conduct (R769) and could not say Patterson had incited his men to bear arms (R767).
Patterson, as a witness in his own behalf, gave the following narrative of his actions and conduct on night of 24.-25 June 1943s . He worked with company in the master motor pool of camp. At 5s30 p.m. he went to "chow" and company commander ordered company to return to pool in evening. The company was preparing to move next day.

He left snack-bar between 10:30 and 11:00 p.m. and proceeded to his barracks. He noticed two or three soldiers running in direction of camp infirmary (R77l). He then walked towards infirmary and saw two soldiers. One said: "Sergeant Patterson, one of your men got shot (naming him)".
Then Patterson went to infirmary door where company commander inform? ed him that Ogletree.and a boy from 1919th company had been shot. Patterson returned to his barracks at about 10:15 p.m. As he walked towards barracks he saw an ambulance leave. He went to latrine and then orderly room where he 'heard confusion in the road.

Major Keris told him to take a specified jeep, and directed that Lieutenant Bjerke and a sergeant accompany him. As they started Major Heris asked Lieutenant Bjerke and Patterson to give their word of honor that they would go to the Warrington hospital and'report back to him. He shook hands with them (R778). Drove out of Access Road about 11:30 p.m. Saw outside of camp two military police with "tommy" guns and Sergeant Bentley and Henry Bryant.
Stopped jeep and went over to police. Lieutenant Moll, the chaplain, came up to Bentley and told him he "had too damned much mouth", but told Bentley to get in jeep and Bryant to go back to camp (R774). On returning from V/arrington and at a short distance from camp gates someone shouted: "Turn out them lights" and asked who was there. Patterson identified himself and said he was returning from the hospital; that the men were all right and that all should come back to the barracks, Patterson and party were stopped once more as they were about to turn into officers' quarters. Patterson left jeep at corner in company with Lieutenant Bjerke. They proceeded as far as officers' quarters when they saw a command car in front of it containing Lieutenant Ousset, He was shouting for some one to take him into the dispensary. There was an enlisted man driving car (R780,787). Lieutenants Warjackie, Roller and Bjerke walked in front of car and

Patterson walked by the side of it. Lieutenant Ousset was taken into dispensary. Patterson accompanied- party and remained until 4s00 a.m. on 25 June. Patterson.picked up a rifle in entrance-way to dispensary and on encountering Captain Gerardot asked him what to do with it. Captain Gerardot told Patterson to place it inside the door-way and help Lieutenant Ousset into the dispensary . which Patterson did (R78l), While in the dispensary Patterson took three rounds of ammunition out of his left-hand pocket and placed it on desk in presence of other people. The three rounds had been obtained from one of the rifles of the company which Patterson had taken to his room (782, 788). One hundred rifles were missing from supply room but company was under control because officers were talking to them (R789). Assisted in collecting company rifles next day - found 32 rifles in another barracks. Patterson denied saying to Sergeant Hicks that he hoped the men were all right for otherwise "I do not know what. I would do," but did say he hoped Ogletree was all right (R790). Denied saying: "Well, By God, I -am going to find out who shot them", and "I am going to do something about it." (R792). Patterson intended to. repobt’. Ogletree' s and Adams' condition to company. Ke reported to Major Heris upon return. Patterson denied he had ever received a direct order from Major Heris or any other officer, and denied he had told Lieutenant Saniter he could not control his men (R793). He returned the 16 rifles to the store room next day (R794).

Sergeant J.D.Bentley went to Warrington with Patterson in a jeep. He . got into the jeep under impression that Patterson was ordering him to do so (R801).

MACK
Captain Anderson identified Mack as one of the soldiers who was in the carry-all and approached the camp gate ahead of the truck containing armed soldiers. Captain Anderson ordered Mack and others from the carry-all. At that time Mack was armed with a rifle.Captain Anderson ordered all of the men to return to barracks and surrender their.rifles but could not truthfully testify that Mack disobeyed (R57,58,65,66,70-72).

JAMES E. JOHNSON
Lieutenant Ryland saw Johnson outside of Barracks B v/ith a rifle (R212).

■ -Lieutenant Ryland had known Johnson- rather closely for about a year and considered him of value to military service; His reputation'for * . * .	. -	truth	and veracity was good (R727).
(a)	Beyond question there is competent substantial evidence that Patterson, Cradic and Mack were each in possession of fire-arms during'the night of 24-25 June 1943. Accused James E. Johnson admits he entered the supply room and obtained a rifle and thereafter possessed same. The discussion in paragraph 10 hereof as to the legal issues involved under the proof of Charge ill and its Specification is.here applicable and need not be repeated. The record is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty of ’these four named accused of Charge III and its Specification.
(b) As to accused Ogletree there is not even.a scintilla of evidence that he possessed fire-arms’at the time and place alleged. The findings of Guilty of Charge III and its Specification cannot be supported on .the basis of wrongful and unlawful possession of fire-arms. The finding of Ogletree's guilt of Charge III and its Specification will be treated hereinafter in connection with the finding of his guilt of Charge II and its Specification (joining in a riot).'
(c)	The accused Cradic belonged to the group of soldiers which included Engram, 'Flagg, ‘Saffo and Kirksey (see paragraph 10 supra) who were seen with rifles by Lieutenant Saniter between 10:40 p.m. and midnight (178, 188). The four named accused 7/ere acquitted by the court of the charge of joining in a mutiny (Gharge I and its Specification^ and committing a riot (Charge II and its Specification). Cradic,"likewise, was acquitted of joining in a mutiny. The evidence against Cradic is of the same quality, weight and substance as that against the four mentioned accused and requires the same treatment as was accorded by the court in.the latter instances. Cradic was undoubtedly guilty of wrongfully and unlawfully possessing a rifle at the time and place alleged, but even the prosecution's evidence exculpates“him from further responsibility. Accordingly the Board of Review is of .the opinion that the record is legally insufficient to support the finding of accused Cradic guilty of Charge II and.its Specification" (committing riot).
(d)	As to accused James E. Johnson, evidence is wholly lacking as to any pernicious or illegal activity during the evening'except his possession of a rifle which by his written statement (Prob.Ex.6)’ he admits he secured from the supply room. He was acquitted of the charge of. joining-in a mutiny (Charge I and its specifications). : The Board of Review is of. the opinion that the record is legally insufficient to support the finding " of Johnson’s guilt of Charge II and its Specification.

(e)	There remains to be considered the guilt of Patterson,. Mack and Ogletree of the charge of committing riot (Charge II and its Specification). Hereinbefore the essential elements of the offense have been set forth (paragraph 7c and d, supra). The' Board of Review in its holding CM ETO 804., Ogletree et al, reference to which has been made herein, considered at length the nature of the offense of committing riot under the 89th Article of War, wherein military personnel is involved. It was there concluded that the crime could be committed at places other than "quarters, ’ garrison, camp and on the march". However; such conclusion does not deny that a riot may be committed by soldiers within and uppn a military reservation or establishment.	1
"A riot is a riot even though the rioters are soldiers and it takes place in a military camp" (39 T.L.R.7; 54 C.J., sec.
3,	p.830, footnote 25).
That a riot prevailed at AAF Station #569'on the night of 24-25 June 1943.has been adequately demonstrated. There was a violent disturbance of the public peace. Life and limb were put in jeopardy by the •uncontrolled discharging of fire-arms, and many armed men were active in the disorders. Ammunition stores had been robbed and a condition of hysterical excitement prevailed. The fact that British civilians were not injured or threatened by the immediate disturbance in the camp is irrelevant.
"Riot is essentially an offense against the public peace and good order, and looks to .	this rather than an infraction of the per-
sonal rights of any particular individual as such. It involves the execution of an agreement, express or implied between three or more persons to commit an assault or battery or a breach'of the peace. ***♦.
The place where the riot occurs is immaterial. ■****.
The violent and turbulent enterprises .. of bodies of men have uniformly been considered as dangerous to the rights of other citizens. Thus where a band,of persons makes an uproar and displays arms, or marches on a public street with violence and without a.permit, or makes an assault accompanied with loud threats and threatening display of force, or forcibly destroys the property of another, a riot may be committed, often in combination with another offense. ****». Mischief makers may become rioters, while indulging in a charivari, or in holiday celebrations. Intimidating or resisting civil officers may constitute a riot and so may the coercion of workmen.

Malicious_mischief, .night disorders, pole raising, and prize fights may also become riots.'The forcible appropriation of-prop--erty is‘an act of riotous tendency, while • public meetings are prolific sources of this offense. *■***.
The common law rule requires that three '■ or more persons must act together in • committing the offense, and most of the statutes defining•riot provide that the offense cannot be committed' by less than three persons. **-**.
• It is not necessary that the riotous -
. violence should have been premeditated , by the assembled perpetrators; therefore the
. original assembly may have been by accident or for a lawful purpose. **■**." (54 C.J., secs.3,4 and 5, pp,830,831,832)i
The legal principles involved in determining the responsibility of Patterson,. Hack and Ogletree are found in the following statements:
"All persons who are actually or constructively present at the time arid place of a crime, whether-it is a felony or merely a-misdemeanor, and who either actually aid,
■	abet, assist, or advise its commission,	’	'
or-are there with that purpose in mind, .
to the-knowledge of the party actually committing the~crime, are guilty as prin-
■	cipals* in the second degree, although they
• did not themselves accomplish the purpose.";
(16 C.J,, sec.117, p.130; 22 C.J.3., sec.
8$a,-p.157).
"So, among offenders,-the-Articles recognize no principals, and no accessories either before or after the fact, as such. The grades of crimes and of participators in
■	crime, familiar to the common law, are ' , unknown to the_law military, - and the embarr- • assing technicalities which have-grown out •" of the division of crimes into principal-and • accessorial are wholly foreign to the proce-
... dure of .courts-martial. In the 'military ■
■ practice all aroused persons are treated as independent offenders. Even though they may '. be jointly charged and tried,•as for partici--pation in a mutiny -for example, and each may be guilty of a distinct measure of criminality calling for a distinct punishment, yet all are principals in law." (V.inthrop1 s Military lav/ & Precedents, Reprint, p.108).

"But- where two or more persons acting with' a common intent jointly engage in the same undertaking and jointly commit an unlawful act, each is chargeable with liability and responsibility for the acts of all'the' others, and each is guilty of the offense committed, to which he has contributed to the same extent as if he were the sole offender. And the common purpose need not be to commit the particular crime which is committed; if two persons join in a purpose to commit a crime, each of them, if actually or constructively present, is not only guilty as a principal, if the other commits that particular crime, but he is also guiltybf any other crime committed by the other in pursuance of the common purpose, or as a natural or probable consequence thereof. In order to show a community of unlawful purpose ■ it is not necessary to show an express agreement or an understanding between the parties.
Nor is it necessary that the conspiracy or common purpose shall be shown by positive evidence; its’ existence may be inferred from all the circumstances accompanying the doing of the act, and from conduct of defendant subsequent to the criminal act; in other words, preconcert or a community of purpose may be shown by circumstances as well as by direct evidence." (16 C.J*, sec.115, p.-128;
• 22 C.J.S., sec.87a, p.155).
Patterson's conduct during the disturbance and his participation therein is frankly revealed by his own testimony. The evidence of the prosecution serves only to high-light and explain it. He was first.sergeant of the company. It is manifest that he had established leadership and influence over the enlisted men thereof. . This 'leadership and influence was also recognized by the company officers. The fact that Llajor Heris in granting him permission to make the trip to the Warrington hospital elected to treat with him on an "individual to individual" basi3 and put him upon his "honor to return" unconsciously bespeaks volumes as to his position in the company and among his men. ~ His stature in this respect cannot be ignored in analyzing his conduct on this occasion. It is, in fact, the most vital point in the case against him.. Patterson became highly excited and reached an emotional stage approaching hysteria. There is substantial evidence that these demonstrations of emotional stress occurred in the presence of the men over whom he exerted more than usual influence. Reason and logic both dictate that such conduct on Patterson' s part effectually. served to increase the unrest and anger of the men who saw and heard him, and assisted materially in aggravating tbe disturbance. Considering the entire evidence with respect to Patterson, both the favorable and unfavorable, but one conclusion can be reached. Patterson was not a mere

spectator, by-stander or non-participant, but he was an aider and abetter in creating the riotous condition in camp. The fact that he occupied a position of influence and prestige made his conduct thg more damaging to public peace, good order and military discipline. The Board of Review is of the opinion that the record is legally sufficient to sustain the’ findings that Patterson'was guilty of joining in a riot (Charge II and its Specification).
Eack’s case requires but little consideration. He was one of the armed men who rode in the carry-all to the gate and were stopped and turned back by Captain Anderson. Mack possessed a rifle and was using Government property without order or authority. A riotous condition prevailed in the camp at this time. Here was an overt act which stands undenied and unexplained. It convicts hack of joining in a riot. The finding of the ■ court is sustained by substantial competent evidence.
Ogletree's position is a peculiar one and requires special treatment. He and Adams had been shot in a street brawl with military police earlier in the evening. The fact that they had been wounded was the origin and cause of the disorders and disturbance which followed. Distorted narratives of the events occurring a short time previously in Bamber Bridge stirred the emotions and animosity of the'ir fellow soldiers. Both wounded men returned to camp and were taken to the dispensary. Their presence excited curiosity and interest and their condition and actions directly influenced the conduct of the other soldiers. A group had gathered in front of the dispensary as Ogletree and Adams were assisted from the truck. Seizing this opportunity Ogletree in a pitch of excitement and anger shouted: "I am fighting. I am still fighting. Are you not going to get those guys?". Language of this nature coming from one Of the victims of a supposed unfair attack would certainly serve to influence the sympathies of the auditors and incite them to acts of violence and breaches of the peace. Ogletree became thereby one of the principal originators of the disorder and he was certainly guilty of "joining in a riot" (Charge II and Specification). As heretofore noted there i3 no evidence that he was in possession of fire-arms. However, his harangue to thfe soldiers while being assisted into the dispensary also constituted "inflammatory statements in presence of other soldiers" under Charge III and its Specification and is complete proof of such offense.
It must be noted that making "inflammatory statements in the presence of other soldiers" (and thereby constituting the offense under the 96th Article of War) is part of the proof sustaining the charge of "joining in a riot" (under the 89th Article of War). This is not an improper multiplication of charges,but since the two offenses were substantially the same transaction, the sentence must not exceed the maximum authorized for a single offense (lid.!., 1928, par,80, p.67; CM 231710 (194-3), Bill. JAG., Vol.II, No.5, Hay 1943, par.428(5), p.187; Cf: Dig.Ops.JAG., 1912-1940, par.428(5), pp.294,295).	Ogletree's approved sentence includes dishonor-
able discharge, total forfeitures and confinement at hard labor for three years. There is no maximum limit for punishment for violation of the 89th Article of War, except that death is excluded (AW 43; MCH., 1928, par.104c, p.99). Consequently Ogletree has not been prejudiced.

Prosecution's Evidence.	Defense's	Evidence.-
DAVIS
Captain Anderson testified that 'Davis appeared at the camp gate early in the disturbance and there encountered Captain Anderson. He was excited, wrathful and indignant. He delivered an ultimatum to Captain Anderson whereby he declared that he would be responsible for the good conduct of his men if the military police were removed; otherwise he would not be responsible. Upon Captain Anderson's refusal to entertain such proposition,- Davis asked for permission to go through the gate to see if the military police were gone. Captain Anderson gave such permission.
Davis went through the gate and, upon his return said:. "There' is‘a-. whole detachment there". Captain Anderson answered: "You go back to the barracks and take the men with you and leave the 13?s to me". Captain Anderson departed, and did not know if Davis and the men returned to barracks (R59,69,70-72).
Captain Milnamow saw Davis at the dispensary and asked him what he thought he would gain out of the demonstration and disturbance.
Davis stated he did not think the MPs were1 giving them (colored soldiers) a "fair break" (R119).
Lieutenant McCarthy identified Davis as one of . the soldiers who came into the crowd of soldiers at the company supply room. Lieutenant McCarthy asked him to help' quiet the group. Davis said he could control them if proof was given that the MPs who did the shooting were under guard, and insisted that he and one or two *
Captain Anderson amplified his testimony as to meeting Davis at camp gate. Captain Anderson replied to Davis' ultimatum: "You are not dictating to the United States Army". Davi3 replied: "No sir, I am not . trying to dictate.'1* Captain Anderson considered Davis? attitude as imply-, ing he. had to look after his men.
After that.conversation Davis asked permission to go through the gate and such permission was granted (R414).
Private Harry Miles was a sentry . at gate on night of 24- June. He allowed Davis to go through gate because he had a Class A pass (R150). • •
Davis testified as a witness on his own behalf (R457). In his conversation with Lieutenant McCarthy at the company supply room, Lieutenant McCarthy said to Davis: "Do something, do something". Davis asserted' that he replied that he would try but there was nothing he could do unless he could get some assurance that the 19 men returning on pass would be able to return in safety and would not be subject to be shot as had been stated -by some men. He claims he further said to Lieutenant McCarthy: "May I make a * suggestion, sir? I believe if Captain Anderson assured the men that the men returning on pass could return in safety, the men might quiet -down"
(R459,466). Lieutenant McCarthy,
Davis, Reed and Gallier started to- -wards guardhouse. About 20 yards from .barracks Lieutenant McCarthy said:
"The men are following us". Davis replied: "I do not think they are following us. I think they are returning to their quarters". Davis

other NCOs should see then under guard. Lieutenant McCarthy agreed-to take Davis and Reed to see Captain Anderson. Gallier insisted upon accompanying them. Upon departing the crowd of soldiers • followed, hade was leading the group. Lieutenant McCarthy said to i/ade: "Stop those men and take1 them back". Lade replied: "You stop them, I can not". Davis returned to the group and told them to wait for fifteen minutea and if he was not back with satisfactory answer they could do whatever they wanted (A137-140,1M6).
Upon appearing before Captain Anderson, Davis was assured by Captain Anderson that all I.Ps were in the hospital. Davis insisted that all IPs be taken from the street. Ha jor Heris then gave •
Davis permission to make inspection and Davis departed for town (R140,149). Davis returned and reported that the military police were on the street. Soon thereafter a military police armored car arrived at the gate. Davis yelled:
"I am going back to get the company" (R141). Davis had no rifle during the evening (R147). He was not disrespectful but he did not help quiet the soldiers and he made demands (R149,154) • When bed-check was made at 5:00 a.m. on 25 June the barracks were locked. Lieutenant McCarthy talked to Davis who said all of the men were in but refused to open the doors of barracks for Lieutenant I.IcCarthy (R152), Davis had been recommended for officers' candidate school by Lieutenant McCarthy, who considered him a good first sergeant (R151, 153,154).
Lieutenant Bjerke, upon hearing disturbance went to company head-
then told Hade to- instruct the men to return to quarters. ’Jade asked Davis: "How long will you be gone?" Davis answered:- "about 15 minutes". Hade spoke to the men and they did not follow. Davis specifically denied that he said: "If I am not back in 15 minutes, you-men can do what you please." Thene were 40 or 50 men following and some had arras (R459,466,467,474). At the gate Lieutenant McCarthy and Davis talked to Captain Anderson who gave him permission to go to end of Access Road which he did. He saw military police and then returned and informed Captain Anderson who said he would take care of them (R459,468). Davis testified he informed Captain Anderson that he could not control his men because they were frightened that the men out on pass would be shot or hurt,, and his men wanted an assurance that the others would return in safety (R467-). Davis further denied that he had said to Lieutenant Huxtable that -some of his men had been shot and that they would take things into their own hands ■ (R474). On returning to barracks Davis asserted he found eight rifles which he picked up and put in racks - one outside and seven in the supply room. None had been fired. He had no other rifle in his possession that night (R459). Davis then went to the dis- • pensary. .Captain Llilnamow and Lieutenant Bjerke came in. Davis appealed to Lieutenant Bjerke for a detail of ten men to pick up rifles which was refused (R46O). Davis asserted that none of the company officers gave him a direct order that night. He was only told to return to his barracks (R474). There was a rifle in hall of dispensary and some ammunition on a table (R475). Davis further denied that he said to Captain llilnamow that he thought the I.Ps were not giving his men a fair chance. Captain

quarters and saw Davis in his room. Davis said two of his men had been shot in cold blood. Lieutenant Bjerke asked Davis to talk to men and quiet them down. He was asked by Lieutenant Bjerke a second time. Davis replied: "Yes,Sir", but did not accompany Lieutenant Bjerke into the barrack hallway where many men had congregated (R156). Lieutenant Bjerke accompanied Lieutenant McCarthy, Davis, Reed and Gallier to see Captain Anderson. Lieutenant Bjerke heard Davis say: "On condition that we get to see Captain Anderson and have MPs put in confinement". As the party started for main gate and soldiers attempted to follow Davis said to them: "If I am not back in 15 minutes you can do what you like" (R161). Upon reaching gate Davis asked Captain Anderson about having the military police confined. Captain Anderson replied:- "You are not dictating to us" (Rl62,170).
' Lieutenant Arcuri saw 12 or 15 men with rifles, helmets and gas masks in front of B building. Davis was. among them. Lieutenant Arcuri told Davis he should tales himself and men back to company area. Davis re- -fused saying he would not leave* until he was sure the men in Bamber Bridge were safe. Davis had a rifle which he carried at port-arms, but Lieu-' tenant Arcuri did not know whether he had helmet or gas mask (R194-, 197, 198).
\ Lieutenant Huxtable saw Davis at gate about 11:00 p.m. with Lieutenants McCarthy and Bjerke. Davijg said something about the men' being shot ' in the back and that something ought to be done about j.t, Davis further said that they (meaning the soldiers) were going to take things into their own hands if something were not done
about it (R271-274). '
llilnamow asked: "Have you had any trouble down town?" Davis 'answered: "Yes, on* numerous occasions I have been stopped by the I.iPs and asked to present my pass seven or eight times" (R474). Davis asserted he* * saw no one point a rifle at the armored car and heard no shot when it left (R475).
Captain Milnamow testified he saw Davis at dispensary but did not see him with rifle or other weapon up to 2:00 p.m. (R478). In the course of a conversation between Captain Gerardot, Lieutenant Warjackie, Lieutenant. Bjerke and Captain Milnamow, Davis said Lieutenant Sylvester was not- a good company officer, did not hold* the esteem of his men and did not display enough military bearing. None of the officers agreed with or contradicted Davis. Davis was not disrespectful. When ' Captain Milnamow asked Davis what he expected to achieve by his actions, Captain Milnamow referred to enlisted personnel as a whole and.not to Davis in particular (R4B0).

Lieutenant McCarthy asserted that Wade had a rifle while standing at company store room door. Lieutenant Bjerke attempted to take It, but Wade turned his back on tiim (R13S). Wade-was in front of group that followed Lieutenant McCarthy, Davis and Reed to see Captain Anderson. Lieutenant • McCarthy said to Wade: "Sergeant, stop these men and -take them back'1-.
Wade replied: "You stop them, Sir, I cannot" (R139). Wade had a rifle but he stopped with his men (R146,147).
Lieutenant Bjerke was ‘at the company headquarters with Lieutenant McCarthy. Wade ‘and other men had rifles (R157). There were about 30 or 35 men outside gun room. Lieutenant Bjerke requested Wade to surrender ' rifle. Wade turned his 'back ‘and made no reply (R157,l60,173,174).
Wade as a witness on his own behalf asserted he was in his barracks from about 6:00 p.m, to 11:30 p.m. on 24 June 1943 when he heard a disturbance outside. Lieutenant McCarthy came to the * *barracks and talked to the men ' . (R4B8). Wade did not hear what Lieutenant McCarthy said. He left his barracks followed by the men and Wade. It was about 11:45 p.m. Lieutenant McCarthy was going to see Captain Anderson. Lieutenant McCarthy said he did not want the men to go to the gate. Davis told Wade "to take over". Wade told the men to go back to the barracks They complied. Wade went with them Wade did not have a rifle at that time (R490,492). At time Lieuten- • ant Bjerke was talking to men several put their rifles on floor, Wade picked one up and put it in his room to prevent men from walking on it. Did not have any ammunition (R492). The arms were all carbines - not rifles. Wade denied that he turned his back on any officer when the officer tried to take a carbine from him (R492,494).

Lieutenant McCarthy saw Gallier with a carbine at company supply room door. He was hysterical. Lieutenant McCarthy shook him by the arms, but he did become quiet (R138, 146). Gallier insisted upon accompanying Lieutenant- McCarthy, Davis and Reed to see Captain Anderson.
He. was ordered to return but refused to obey and continued with the three men. When Davis was: authorized to go outside the gate Gallier attempted to accompany him, Lieutenant" McCarthy ordered him back (R139»140). Gallier took a rifle to the gate (R149) and he was the one soldier to whom Lieutenant McCarthy gave a direct order to return to barracks (R153).
Lieutenaht Bjerks saw Gallier with rifle at headquarters (R157). Gallier accompanied Lieutenants McCarthy and Bjerke and Davis and Reed to see Captain Anderson. He was excited but Lieutenant Bjerke "could not sayi he was raising against authority" (Rl6l, 163).

After Davis had departed for town under Captain Anderson's permission Reed was with colored soldiers in front of the guardhouse who were talking of ill-treatment of their race. Reed said in effect that he would rather fight for his race than he would against our enemies (R140, l/t.1) .
Lieutenant Bjerke testified Reed was one of the men who had rifles in the company headquarters (R157). When accompanying Lieutenant McCarthy's party to the camp gate Reed talked about his down trodden race. He was excited but Lieutenant Bjerke could not say he was raising against authority (R161,162).
Reed had made a previous written statement to the Inspector General, which on Reed's cross-examination was admitted in evidence with cautionary instruction against its use with respect to co-defendants (R507-512).
The part of the statement, which conflicts with Reed's testimony was read to the court. It was offered by way of impeachment only (R513). In part it reads as follows: "I changed to fatigue clothes. I could hear men running towards the rifle room. I went down and found out that someone had kicked in the lower part of the door to the rifle room and the carbines were laying outside the room. I took one in my hands. The reason I took this gun was because I had heard that the Li.P's were coming to the camp with machine guns, hand grenades, and riot guns. If they came, I wanted to protect myself. I had no ammunition and I did not see anyone else with any. I had the gun in my hands only a few minutes when Lieutenant Joseph McCarthy and Lieutenant Jeroy Bjerke appeared.

(R513).
HILL
; ‘ ■, Captain Anderson positively identified Hill as being one of the armed men who.were in the carry-all which he stopped as an attempt was made to drive it from the camp gate. Captain Anderson's jeep was parked in Access Road. After Hill had been stopped he said to Capthin Anderson: "Captain,
I'd move that jeep if I were you."
Hill entered the jeep and tried to move it but Captain Anderson removed the keys and ordered him out of it and back to quarters but Captain Anderson did not believe Hill returned to quarters (R57,58,66,70,7l). .
Lieutenant Saniter saw Hill while . an armored car was at the camp gate about 11:15 p.m. Hill was behind a. carry-all which stood at the entrance to the motor pool on left-hand side of Access Road facing inward. Hill pointed a rifle at the armored car and told Lieutenant Saniter to-get. out of the line of fire. Lieutenant * Saniter withdrew and.did not attempt to take Hill's rifle nor order him to give it to him (R188), Hill was not on guard that night and.had no right to possession of rifle (R189).

Hill then had a rifle. Lieutenant TJillis took his name but no orders were given Hill to surrender his rifle (R2641, Shortly afterwards an armored car appeared at .the gate. Hill walked over to a carry-all, then standing near motor-pool and put his gun over the hood and pointed it at the armored car.

Johnson gave Hicks 25 rounds of ammun-_ ition. Hicks walked up to Johnson and told him: "we wanted him to go in".

(a) The defense made vigorous objections to the admission of evidence as iJo the breach of the peace and rioting occurring in the town of Bamber Bridge (described in CM ETO 804, Ogletree et al) prior to the outbreak of violence and disorder in AAF Station #569 (R34-36,54). These objections were overruled. The defense also moved to strike evidence of acts of violence, disorder and rioting which occurred in places distant from the camp, simultaneously with the rioting in the camp. These motions were particularly directed at the testimony of the civilian witnesses Constable (R106), Laidler (R109,110) and Ashcroft (R112) and of Private First Class Miller (R259). Thereafter the defense moved to exclude all evidence pertaining to incidents in Bamber Bridge on the ground that same had not been shown to be connected with the accused who were accounted for in camp (R265). All of these motions were severally denied.
•
In considering the guilt of the accused named in paragraphs 10 and 11 hereof the Board of Review elected to ignore the effect of evidence of the rioting	and disorder occurring exterior	to	the camp and based	its conclusions on	the facts and conditions proved	as	existing solely at	the station.
Consideration of evidence of the prior riot in Bamber Bridge and of the evidence of subsequent violence and disorder-prevailing at places exterior to the camp was postponed until the cases against the seven accused named above.in this!paragraph were discussed, but such consideration is of course, equally applicable to all of the accused.
The testimony of Major Heris (R34,35,36) and of Corporal Roy A. Windsor (R54) refers to the prior riot on Station Road in Bamber Bridge in which Ogletree and Adams, were wounded. One of the first questions arising . in the mind	of the court would be as to the	cause of the outbreak	in camp.
Such events	as occurred at AAF Station #569	do	not simply happen;	they are
caused or motivated by some situation or some condition. The testimony which defense considered objectionable in this respect was highly illuminating to the court. It was thereby informed that street fighting had - previously occurred in which soldiers stationed at AAF Station #569 and military police were involved; that policemen were injured and two. colored soldiers .were shot; that the wounded soldiers returned to camp and that there resulted from this combination of circumstances the disorders and

disturbances giving rise to the instant charges. The testimony was admissible as evidence of motive and intent on-the part of the accused and in explanation of the cause of their subsequent conduct (31 C.J.S., sec.178, p.879; Jones' on Evidence - 2nd Ed. - sec.138, p.154-} 20.Am.Jur. Evidence, sec.273, pp.260,261; Cf: Ulrich vs. Schwarz, 225-NW(Wis) 195,
63 ALR 886).
The motions to strike the evidence of.the acts of violence and disorder at places exterior to the camp but occurring simultaneously with the disorders in the camp itself, are directed primarily at proof of the ten episodes hereinabove specifically narrated. It must be frankly admitted that except as to Doakes (who was acquitted) there is no,proof that any accused were actors in or were present at these riotous and . violent events. The admission of evidence pertaining to same must therefore be justified on some other basis than accuseds1 actual physical participation therein.
Beyond all doubt" the* persons who committed these unlawful acts wbre colored soldiers' from AAF •Station #569. 'There is reliable substantial evidence, that a number of them without permission left the station soon after rumors concerning the shooting of Ogletree' and Adams spread through camp. They were armed with rifles and in possession of ammunition. At least two and probably more, government motor vehicles occupied by armed men'were driven from camp. Some of the exterior acts of violence occurred on public streets immediately, adjacent to the camp, and were in fact part of the camp disorders. Others transpired considerable distances from, the: camp and there were other episodes which had their situs within’ lesser distances.. Tp determine the admissibility of this evidence on the basis of distances from camp of the occurrence of the’ several events is an irrational treatment of the situation and denies its actualities.
The legal principles set forth in paragraph lie, pp.50,51 hereof are applicable. The accused together with the soldiers who cpmmitted the wrongful illegal acts out of their presence were engaged in a common enterprise, were motivated by a common cause ahd possessed a common purpose. . The serious disorders-and breaches of discipline which arose in camp and the ten episodes within the town of Bamber Bridge were part and parcel of a single unlawful demonstration. The court was entitled to be informed, as to the nature and extent of the disturbance as a whole. The distincyasserted by’the defense between acts of violence without the camp and those within the station limits was artificial and without merit. The denial of the motions to strike evidence pertaining to the violence and disturbances exterior to the,camp limits was proper.
• i (b) Walter Johnson’s guilt is dependent upon the following evidence:
(l). The testimony of Purcelle T. Johnson (R66l,662) on cross-examination wherein he named Walter Johnson as a person who criticised him dilring the time of the disturbance in camp for his (Purcelle's) conduct towards certain other soldiers. The law Member committed error in his attempt to exclude this testimony (MCM., 1928, par.l20<J, p.125; 28 USCA,

(2)	The morning report of the company which showed Walter , Johnson's absence without leave on 25 June 19-43, which was clearly admissible in evidence on the authenticating evidence presented to the court
(h339-34l).
(3)	The testimony of Sergeant Hicks that he apprehended Johnson about 5:00 p.m. on 25 June 1943 in Manchester - 60 miles from camp -in possession, without authority, of a government motor vehicle, a rifle and amunitionj that Hicks asked Johnsons "'What the hell he was doing down here with a gun?"; that Johnson replied: "I did not take the jeep," and that'Hicks then said "What are you doing with the gun then"; and that Johnson through an artifice escaped from Hicks' custody but vra3 again apprehended on the morning of 26 June 1943 in Manchester (R308,312,313).
The evidence proves that Johnson was absent without leave; that he was unlawfully in possession of Government property at Manchester and that he escaped from custody (AW 96), but these are not the offenses with which he was charged and upon which he was brought to trial, Hicks' evidence pertained to episodes occurring at least twelve hours subsequent to the termination cf the disturbance in camp and at a location sixty mile3 distant therefrom. They were too ‘remote, both as to time and place, to possess any relevancy to the offenses charged. Purcelle T. Johnson's testimony placing Walter Johnson in camp during the tumult and rioting and evidence of Walter Johnson's absence without leave'form a connection too nebulous in character to serve as proof of any participation in the offenses alleged. Under- such circumstances there is a fatal variance which constituted a cct,.d failure of proof of the offenses alleged (31 C.J., sec.459, n.245; -CM 224109, Bui.JAG., Sep 1942, Vcl.I,* No,4,'sec.427(63), p.214;

spectators, by-standers or non-rparticipants but each accused was active in either promoting or aggravating the disturbance. In spite of conflicts in the evidence and explanatory evidence on behalf of certain accused the findings of the court that each of them committed a riot are supported by substantial and convincing evidence. The Board of Review is of the opinion that as to these named accused the record is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty of Charge II and its Specification.
• Each of them, during the course of the night was in possession of a rifle or carbine and there is substantial evidence fully supporting the court's finding that such possession was -wrongful -and unlawful. The record is legally sufficient to support the finding of their guilt of the offense alleged in Charge III and its Specification.
(d) Davis. Wade, Gallier, Reed, Hill and Starks are each charged (Charge I) with (l) joining in a mutiny against the lawful authority of the camp commander (Specification l) and (2) joining in a mutiny against lawful authority of the military police (Specification 2) with the intent of usurping, subverting and overriding the authority of the camp commander in the first instance and the authority of the military police in the second instance.
Mutiny is defined:
"Concerted insubordination, or concerted	.	.
opposition or resistance to, or defiance of, lawful military authority, by two or more persons subject to such authority, with the intent to usurp, subvert, or override such authority, or to neutralize it for the time being." (MCM., 1917, par.417, p.213j MCM.,

,	XXII	A,	p.123;	Winthrop's	Military Law &

«
One of the principal elements of mutiny is the intent to override, supplant or neutralize lawful authority.
"The intent which distinguishes mutiny **** is the intent to resist lawful authority in

"Mutiny has been variously described, but in general not in such terms as fully to distinguish it from some other military crimes, the" characterizing intent not being sufficiently recognized. **»*. It Is this intent which distinguishes it from the other offences ***. The definition of mutiny at military law is indeed best illustrated by a reference to

the adjudged cases treating of that offense : as understood at maritime lair. Thus, in .regard 'to mutiny or revolt on American merchant vessels it has been expressly held that an • intention to overthrow for the time at'least ?• the lawful authority of the master is an • essential element of the crime,' that simple violence against the officer, without proof " of intent to override his authority, is not sufficient to constitute revolt or mutiny, that mere disobedience of orders, unaccompanied by such intent, does hot amount to mutiny, and that insolent language or disorderly be-.
" havior is per se insufficient to establish it." .
•	(ffinthrop's Military law & Precedents - Reprint
. - pp.578-580).	...
Winthrop discusses>the proof of this specific intent as follows*
"The intent may be openly declared in words, or it may be implied from the act or acts ; done,- as, for example, from the actual subversion or suppression.of the superior authority, from an assumption of the command which belongs to the superior, a rescue or attempt to rescue a prisoner, a stacking of . arms and refusal to march or do duty, a taking up arms and assuming a menacing altitude, &c; or it may be gathered from a variety of. circumstances-no one of which ; • perhaps would of itself alone have 'justified
•	the inference* But the fact of combination-' that-the opposition or resistinance is the proceeding of a number of individuals acting
v . together apparently with a common purpose-'
is, though not conclusive, the most significant, and most usual evidence of the existence of the intent in question." (Winthrop* s Military ' -	Law & Precedents - Reprint - pp*580-581)•	-	•
The second fundamental element of the offense is proof of. the opposition to authority .by the commission of some overt act:
'	*	"While the intent indicated is essential to
the offence, the Same is not completed unless . the opposition or resistance be manifested by some overt act or acts, 'or Specific conduct*
Mere intention however deliberate and fixed, or conspiracy however unanimous, will* fail to constitute mutiny. Words alone, unaccompanied , by acts, will not suffice." (Winthrop*s Military Law & Precedents Reprint - p.58l)»

"The opposition or resistance need not be active or violent. It thus may consist simply in a persistent refusal or omission (with the intent above specified,) to obey orders or do duty." (Winthrop's Military Law & Precedents - Reprint - p.58l; Southern Steamship Co, v. National Labor Relations Board, 316 U.S. 31,40-41,-86 L.Ed., 1246,
1256).
"There can.be no actual mutiny or-sedition until there has been an overt act of insubordination joined in by two or more - • persons. Therefore no person can be found guilty, of beginning or joining in a mutiny unless an overt act of mutiny is proved.
A person is not guilty of beginning a mutiny unless he is the first, or among the first, to commit an overt act of mutiny; and a person can not .loin in a mutiny without .joining in some overt act. Hence presence of the accused at the scene of mutiny is necessary in these two cases." (MCK., 1928, par.136b, p.151) (Under-scoring supplied).
The 66th Article of Jar provides in pertinent parts
"Any person subject to military law who attempts to create or who begins, excites, causes, or joins in any mutiny *** in any company, party, post, camp, detachment, guard, or other command shall suffer death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct." (Underscoring.supplied).
The acts of disorder and violence, breaches of the peace, and the disobedience of orders and regulations which occurred at the time and place alleged have been described in detail. This evidence fully sustains the conclusion that AAF Station #569 and the surrounding and adjacent territory, ' including a principal part of the town Bamber Bridge were on the night of 24-25 June 1943 the scene of a tumultuous, riotous, illegal and wrongful disturbance against the peace and good order of the community. This disorder was not only a riot but the many acts of violence j.n the aggregate constituted insubordination to superior military authority joined in by two or more persons.
Breaking into gun and ammunition storage rooms and the -unauthorized taking of arms and cartridges therefrom; seizure of motor equipment and the driving same from camp; halting and examining of officers, who were engaged in lawful missions; discharge of fire-arms at military police, and the glaring and humiliating fact that the camp officers required the withdrawal

of the military police.in order to prevent further and increased anger and violence on the part of the soldiers, is substantial evidence of the specific intent to override the authority of the military police in which the soldiers exhibited animosity and a spirit of revenge and also of the intent to override and neutralize the authority of the camp commander and his subordinates in order to accomplish the ulterior purpose of attacking the police and subverting and destroying their authority. , All of the elements of a mutiny were therefore'manifestly present (CM 116735, CM 122535, CM 122396, CM 14-5286,, Dig. Ops. JAG,, 1912-1940, sec.424-, pp.288,289)
A mutiny at the time.and place alleged in the specifications (Charge 1, Specifications 1 and 2) against the authority of the damp commander and of the'military police having been established, the guilt of the, six named accused (Davis, Wade, Gallier, Reed, Hill and Starks) is dependent upon the proof that they each joined in the same and committed one or more overt acts of.insubordination. 1 This question was essentially one of fact for the court which listened to the testimony as it unfolded, had seen the witnesses and had observed the demeanor of the accused in the court toom over a period of several^days.. Proof of ^joining in a mutiny4’ and of "overt acts" can be sustained without evidence of acts of physical violence. . Speech, temperate and mild in delivery, or actions, harmless in themselves, can constitute, inculpatory Conduct in offenses of the nature of mutiny, when considered with the surrounding facts and circumstances.
A clever and intelligent person by appropriate and.insidious utterances , can incite and encourage insubordination and unlawful conduct in a manner and degree equally.effective and dangerous as any physical acts he might commit. The power of suggestion when used.propitiously by a leader of a mob sometimes obtains results that no other means.can secure. Davis,
Wade, Gallier and Reed exhibited themselyes as effective agitators and promoters of the. mutiny by the use of these subtle, poisonous means. On the other hand, Hill and Starks each committed acts of a most violent character which were obviously directed against constituted authority. The evidence relating to the actions and conduct of the named accused during the course of the mutiny, in the opinion of. the Board 9f Review fully sustains in a most convincing manner the finding that each of them joined . in and materially aided in the overriding and neutralizing of the authority of both the camp commander and military police by the commission of overt acts over and above mere expressions of sympathy with the unlawful demonstration of the soldiers. In the opinion of the Board, of Review the record is legally stifficient to sustain the findings of the court that Davis, Wade, Gallier, Reed, Hill and Starks were guilty of joining in a mutiny (Charge I and: its specifications).	.	.:;

Janes E. Johnson for two years, are legal'. The offe.nses of which accused were found guilty require-confinement in the disciplinary barracks and not a penitentiary (AW 42). Pursuant to pars.l and 2, Section II, YiD, Cir, #321, 11 December 1943 as amended, the place of confinement of Patterson, Ogletree and Llack should be changed from Eastern Branch, United States Disciplinary Barracks, Beekman, New York to Eastern Branch, United. States Disciplinary Barracks, Greenhaven, New York. The 2912th Disciplinary Training Center, Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England, is the authorized place of. confinement of Cradle and James E. Johnson. However, the sentences of Cradic and James E. Johnson,to dishonorable discharge should be suspended during period of confinement (par.8b and c, Cir. #72, ETOUSA,
9 Sep 1943).	.	...
(c) The approved sentences of Edward R. Williams,. Jr., Frelot, Saffo, Engram, Flagg, Kirksey, Horton, Arbuckle, Avery, Kendall, Roach, Smith, Terrell, Grigg and Wise of dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances due or to become due and confinement at hard labor, Avery for two years, Kendall for three years and the others of the named accused for one year each are authorized sentences. The named accused were convicted of an offense under the 9.6th Article of War for which no statutory maximum punishment’is fixed, except that the sentence of death is prohibited (AYT 43). The Table of Maximum Punishments (KCM., 1928, par.104c, p.97) does not prescribe a maximum punishment for the offenses of which accused Were, convicted (l) wrongfully and unlawfully seizing arms and ammunition;’ (2) wrongfully and unlawfully bearing arms. Neither does the table prescribe a maximum penalty for an offense closely related to these offenses. "Offenses not thus provided for remain punishable as authorized by statute or by the custom qf .the service" (IJCM., 1928, par. 104c, p.96). The sentences are therefore .legal. The place of confinement of Kendall should be changed from .Eastern Branch, United States Disciplinary Barracks, Beekman, New York to Eastern Branch, United States Disciplinary Barracks, Greenhaven, New York which is the authorized place of confinement for him (pars.l and 2, Section II, WD, Cir. #321, 11 December 1943 as amended). The 2912th Disciplinary Training Center, Shepton Mallet, Somerset, England, is the correct place of confinement of the other named fourteen accused. However, as to them the sentences of dishonorable discharge should be suspended.during period of confinement (pars.8b and c, Cir. #72, ETOUSA, 9 Sep 1943).
15. The court was legally constituted and had jurisdiction of the persons and offenses. No errors.injuriously,affecting the substantial rights of the accused, except Cradic, James.E. Johnson and Walter Johnson were committed during the triai. The Board of Review is of the opinion that the record of trial is legally sufficient.to support the findings that the accused:	'■

CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
(133)
(a)	Edward R. Williams, Jr., Frelot, Saffo, Engran, Flagg, Kirksey, Horton, Arbuckle, Avery, Kendall, Wise, Roach, Smith, Terrell and Grigg are each guilty of Charge III and its Specification and to support their respective sentences;
(b)	Patterson, Ogletree and Mack are each guilty of Charges II and III and their respective specifications and to support their respective sentences;
(c)	Cradic and James E. Johnson are each guilty of Charge III and its Specification and to support their respective sentences but insufficient to support the finding of their respective guilts of Charge II and its Specification;
(d)	Davis, Wade, Gallier, Reed, Hill and Starks are each guilty of Charges I, II and III and their respective specifications and to support their respective sentences; but the record is legally insufficient to support the findings of guilty of accused Walter Johnson, and the sentence imposed upon him.
The holding is hereby approved. Under the provisions of Article of War 505- you now have authority to order execution of the sentences of all the accused, except Walter Johnson.
2.	In the case of the accused:	Cradic, James E. Johnson, Edward R.
Williams, Jr., Frelot, Saffo, Engram, Flagg, Kirksey, Horton, Arbuckle,
Avery, Roach, Smith, Terrell, Grigg and ’Wise, the dishonorable discharges should be suspended during their respective periods of confinement inasmuch as they will be confined in Disciplinary Training Center #2912 in this theater.
3.	• Pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2, Section II, VID, Cir. #321, 11 December 194-3, as amended by Section II, WD, Cir. #331, 21 December 194-3, the place of confinement of the accused Davis, Wade, Gallier, Reed, Hill,
Starks, Patterson, Ogletree and Mack should be changed from Eastern Branch, United States Disciplinary Barracks, Beekman, Hew York to Eastern Branch, United States Disciplinary Barracks, Greenhaven, New York.
4.	With respect to accused Walter Johnson, there was a fatal variance between the allegations of the charges and specifications and the proof.
The evidence shows that he v/as probably guilty of (a) absence without leave, (b) unlawful possession of a rifle and unlawful possession and use of a Government motor vehicle at Manchester, England, 25-26 June 1943 and (c) escape from custody under the 96th Article of War. The prosecution failed to connect these offenses with those charged and upon which he was brought to trial. legally speaking he has never been charged or tried for the offenses indicated by the evidence in the record and he may still be brought to trial for such offenses.
5.	In view of the fact that the approved holding of the Board of Review adjudges that the record is legally insufficient to support the
2	-

(13-4)
CONFIDENTIAL
findings of guilty of Charge II and its Specification as to Cradic and James E. Johnson, it is manifest that the periods of their confinement respectively should be reduced to the same duration as that of accused who were found guilty only of Charge III and its Specification. The sentences of all of this group except Kendall and Avery were reduced to one year. It is recommended that the period of confinement in the cases of these two soldiers be reduced to one year. It is also recommended that the dishonorable discharge be suspended as to Private Sidney G. Kendall and that Disciplinary Training Center #2912 be designated as the place for his confinement.
6.	It is apparent from an examination of this record that the worst offenders, those who left camp in defiance of authority and did the firing in the town of Bamber Bridge when the inhabitants were terrorized and Lieutenant Ousset was wounded, were not discovered. This was due to the lack of positive action by the officers of the command. They acted more
as observers then as officers in commnnd of troops. Most of the few orders given were disobeyed and no further affirmative action was taken. As a whole,-their testimony in court was likewise inadequate. It seems incredible that company officers who had been with the same companies for months did not recognize or make note of men who committed definite acts at critical times.
I agree with the statement of Brigadier General Edmund W. Hill, President of the court, contained in his letter 19 September 194-3, recommending clemency as follows:
"It is quite apparent that their acts resulted in great part from lack of able leadership on the part of their superiors. The evidence clearly established an appalling state of discipline and training in the unit and at the station where they were serving. Many of the officers whose job it was to guide and control the action of their men utterly failed in the performance of these duties and refused to meet and accept responsibility. Had these officers exercised the degree of proficiency normally expected, it is reasonable to assume that the offenses might never have been committed, or at least would not have reached such serious proportions. Although it is recognized that these facts do not excuse the misconduct of the accused, they nevertheless serve to explain the underlying cause of the disorder and to lessen the degree of guilt of the accused."
