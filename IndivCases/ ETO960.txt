ADDITIONAL CHARCE:	Violatloa of the 58th Article of War.
Specification:	In	that Private Warren G. Nelson, Company A.,
fourth Replacement Battalion, Tenth Replacement Depot, Whittington Barracks, Lichfield, Staffordshire, England, did at Tenth Replacement Depot, Whittington Barracks, Lichfield, Staffordshire, England, oh or about 1 October 1943' desert the service of the United States and did remain absent in desertion until he was apprehended at Nuneaton, Warwickshire, England,'on or about 7 October 1943.
Each accused pleaded guilty to all charges and specifications with ' the exception of the charges and specifications alleging desertion in violation of Article of War 58, to which each pleaded not guilty. Each was found guilty of all charges and specifications with which he was charged. Evidence of four previous convictions was introduced against accused Fazio, two for "larceny, one for escape from confinement and one for failure to obey a lawful command of his company commander. No evidence of previous convictions was introduced against either Nelson or Poteet. Each was sentenced to be dishonorably discharged the service, to forfeit all pay and allowances due or to become due and to be confined at hard labor at such place as the reviewing authority may direct, Fazio and Nelson for 10 years each and Poteet for 20 years. The reviewing authority approved the sentences, designated the Federal Reformatdry, Chillicothe, Ohio, as the places of confinement for Fazic and Nelson, and the United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, as the place of confinement for Poteet and forwarded the record of trial for action pursuant to Article of Y/ar 50^.
3.	Other than the written statements of each of the accused, no evidence was introduced by the prosecution except in support of the charges and specifications alleging desertion and escape from confinement. The evidence- introduced summarizes as follows:
Captain Marshall F. Hollis, Infantry, on 30 September 1943, was Assistant Provost Marshal in charge of the Western Base Guardhouse at the 10th Replacement Depot, and had received, among others, the three accused as prisoners:	Poteet	for a life term, Fazio for a 10 year term
and Nelson for a 5 year term (R18). About 5:30 on the morning of 1 October 1943, he went to No. 3.Guardhouse, 10th Replacement Depot and found that accused Nelson, Poteet and Fazio had escaped from their cells. They had gone out through the window over the lavatory after prying open their cell doors, and though immediate search was made of the buildings and surrounding territory they were not found. He had not authorized their release and they escaped before being set at liberty by proper authority (R19)•
Corporal Harry S. Carney, 10th-Replacement Depot, worked in the office of the Provost Marshal, and was in charge- of the Guard Book of the Western Base Guardhouse. He produced and identified the book and

the entry therein of 1 October 1943 recitings "Escaped: Fazio, No.29, Poteet, No. 97, Nelson, No.122, escaped from the guardhouse around 0400 hours, 1st October" (R20-21; Pros. Ex."C"). (The records fail to disclose the admission of any exhibits marked Pros. Ex. A and B.)
Private Dillon (NMI) Maynor was on duty at Western Base Guardhouse No.3 on the morning of 1 October 1943. He knew accused had been prisoners in the guardhouse and that they escaped on that morning. He personally searohed for them and they were not in their cells (R22).
Corporal Joseph (NI.Il) Lackup, Company "B", 4th Replacement Battalion was acquainted with the accused. About 4.30 A.M. of 1 October 1943 he came down to No.3 Guardhouse "to collect a man" he made a personal search of the cells and accused were not present.(R23).
Harry Wheeler, Police Inspector, Northamptonshire Constabulary, identified accused Poteet. He saw a soldier dressed in American Army uniform and wearing sergeant's stripes on the night of 6 October 1943 at the Headquarters of a British Artillery unit at West Haddon Hall, , Northamptonshire. He "challenged him with being one of the three escaped American prisoners, Poteet. He produced to me a pink leave pass bearing the name of Charles Allen. In answer to my further questions he became confused, and I took him into custody on suspicion of being Poteet". On further questioning at Police headquarters, the prisoner admitted his identity as Poteet and was handed over to the American authorities (R22).
Mrs. Nellie Weston, George Hotel, Kilsby, near Rugby, identified Poteet and Fazio who registered respectively as Charles Allen and Ben .. , Rainwater at her hotel sometime between 30 September and 6 October 1943. Both later admitted their'true identity to Mrs. Weston and Fazio told her he "would like to give himself;up" and Poteet said he was "willing to come back after December 1st". Poteet said the reason he wanted to stay out till then was a personal matter (R26-27).
Police Sergeant John A. Thomas, Warwickshire Constabulary, in „ response to a telephone message on 7 October (1943) "made a search and found the prisoner Warren (Nelson) at a house in Heath End Road, Nuneaton.
I	told him I suspected him of being a person wanted by -the. U.S. Authorities, and searched him., I found in his possession two dog tags by the name of John R. Smith. I told him he appeared'identical with a man we wanted, arrested him1 and took him to Nuneaton Police Station" (R28). He was	'
dressed in United States Army.uniform with sergeant's stripes (R29).

John Edward Crolcer, Detective Sergeant, Warwickshire Constabulary, on 6 October 1943, as result of a message received from Mrs. Weston at the George Hotel, Kilsby, "went there and saw the prisoner Fazio standing in the bar. • I recognized him as Fazio and told him I was a police officer and should take him into custody.
He said 'I’m the guy’11. He was dressed in American uniform'and was handed over to .the American authorities. He was apprehended about 25 miles from "this station" (the place of escape) (R31).
Second Lieutenant Thomas B. Weatherby, Infantry, who investigated the charges identified various statements which were voluntarily made by the accused after due warning given that they did not have to make any statement and that if they-did it might be used for or against them in a trial by court-martial ,(R32). These statements were offered as confessions "only ‘for the 58th Article of War". The objection by the defense to "three sheets" was sustained and the balance consisting of one statement each of Poteet and Fazio (3 sheets) and three separate . statements of. Nelson were admitted as Pros.'Ex. "D" to "J" .inclusive (R33).
Poteet in his sworn' statement (Pros. Ex "D") stated that he wanted to stay out until his child was- born, that while away he never changed into civilian clothes, and denied that any accused had any weapons while absent. He also stated that "The property which I have been questioned about was taken from me at Northampton where I was taken from West Haddon".
Nelson, in his signed statements, Pros. Ex. "E", "F" and "G", agreed "with the statement of Fazio in so far as it pertains to what we did up to the time I left them" and in so far as it pertained to him Nelson attached and adopted Fazio's statement as his own with certain exceptions. He got some clothes from a barracks not far from Guardhouse No. 3«
"On Monday morning when I parted from the boys I ..went to a girls . house across the street from the Webster's and about three houses down where this girl was staying. She was.of Italian descent. The reason I did not rejoin Fazio and Poteet was that I saw some police outside. I stayed with this girl all > day Monday and Monday night and Tuesday night until about 2200 hours when I left, started back for camp since I had . seen our pictures in the paper and knew that it was useless to try to stay out any longer. I went first to Bedworth where I stayed in the train station that night, and I stayed around Bedworth the next day and caught the train for Nuneaton this morning, 7 October 194-3, at 0630 hours.-.1 got off the train .. at Nuneaton and was arrested there about 30 minutes later by

the civilian police. I did not intend permanently deserting the Army of tne United States but merely wanted to get out and get some whiskey and cigarettes. I have been drinking since I was 15 and can not do without it." (Pros. Ex."F").
He admitted taking two rings, one a wedding band, the other a small wing with five stones in it, from a little box on the dresser of a lady (Mrs.Leeming) living "across the street from Mrs. Webster", and at the same time taking from her a five pound note (Pros.Ex.E).
Fazio in his statement detailed the particulars of the escape of the three accused and of their activities thereafter as long as they were together (Pros.Exs.H-l). He denied any outside assistance of-any sort in the escape (Pros. Ex. "J").
Private Harry -M. Long, Disciplinary Training Centre No. 1 was confined in the Western Base Guardhouse with the accused prior to 1 October 194-3 (R35). About two or three days before they escaped, the accused told him that they would like to get out of the guardhouse and go to a battle front with American troops because their sentences might then be suspended.
A. Three members of the court, Col. Herr, Lt.-Col. Haney and Ca-t;. Mulberg, who were members of a co-irt which had previously tried Fazio and Nelson on other and different charges than the present ones were each challenged for cause by the defense, and each was sworn and questioned. Each denied any prejudice toward accused and stated that he could, as a member of the present court, give accused a fair and impartial trial. One of the three challenged members, the president of the court. Colonel Herr, testified that he had an unfavourable impression of both accused after the last trial which impression was still maintained. The court closed and considered the challenges in the absence of the three members and refused to sustain them. Thereafter the defense announced that there were no peremptory challenges and that there was no objection to any member of the court. (R3-7).	.
The failure of the defense to exercise its peremptory challenges after denial of its challenges for cause prevents any consideration upon appellate review of the court’s action in denying the challenges for cause. (CM ETO 804, Ogletree et al). .
5.	Evidence of four previous.convictions of accused Fazio was received by the court prior to-their announcing their findings. However, the court closed just prior to receiving such evidence and the record does not clearly indicate the order of procedure. Such evidence may be
-7-
CONFIDENTIAL
(196)
received only after the findings have been made, and then only for the purpose of determining the punishment. As Fazio was given the same sentence as Nelson he apparently ?/as not prejudiced by any irregular action of the court.
6.	Several errors and irregularities occurring during the trial have been noted by the Assistant Staff Judge Advocate in his review. As these pertained mostly to form and procedure and did not injuriously affect the substantial rights of the a ccused under the provisions of Article of War37, further comment is unnecessary.
7.	Each of accused pleaded guilty to all charges and specifications against them with.the exception of the charge of desertion under Article of War 58 and its specification. By inference, foteet in his statement refers to the articles he is charged with talcing, when he mentions "the property which I have been questioned about".
Nelson in his statement admits his guilt of the larceny to which he pleaded guilty. Fazio was not charged with larceny. Each was fully advised of the effect of their plea of guilty but declined to change it.
In connection with the charges of larceny there was no evidence except accused's statements. The record is legally sufficient to sustain the charges of larceny against Poteet (Charge II and its Specification;
Charge III and its Specifications) and against Nelson (Charge II and its Specification).
8.	The undisputed evidence fully warrants the findings of guilty as to each accused of escape from confinement. It is also legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty as to each accused cf the charge cf desertion. Each escaped from confinement and there was evidence that each desired to leave the country. Each used a false name while absent. The absence of each accused was terminated by apprehension although it was alleged that Fazio surrendered (CM ETO 952, i'osser;
CM ETO 913, Piemo: CM ETO 823, Foteet: CM ETO 800, TJngard; CM ETO 71,0, Lane). The -trial court passes on disputed facts and is the sole judge thereof. Its findings will not be disturbed when supported by competent substantial evidence. (CM ETO 132, Nelly and Hyde; CM ETO 4.22, Green;
CM ETO 492, Lewis).
9. The present offenses were committed on 1 October and 4 October 1943, charges were preferred 7 October and 12 October, trial was had
on 25 October and action taken 8 November, 1943.
On 27 September 1943 Nelson ms sentenced in a former trial on other charges to dishonorable discharge, total forfeitures and confinement at hard labor for five years. The sentence was approved by the reviewing authority 4 October 1943 and published in a general court-martial order dated 21 October 1943 (CM ETO 839, Nelson).

On 1 September 194-3 Poteet was sentenced in a former trial on other charges to dishonorable discharge, total forfeitures and confinement at hard labor for the term of his natural life. The sentence was approved by the reviewing authority 26 September 194-3 and published in a general court-martial order dated 15 October 194-3 (CM ETO 823,
Poteet).
On 27 September 1943 Fazio was sentenced in a former trial on other charges to dishonorable discharge, total forfeitures and confinement .at hard labor for ten years. The' sentence was approved by the"reviewing authority 13 October 1943 and published on the same day.
As this published order was void because the Board of Review had not acted upon the .record of trial, (AW 50§), the sentence was later published in a "corrected" general court-martiql order dated 29 October 1943 (CM ETO 875, Fazio).
s None of the former sentences to dishonorable discharge were ordered suspended by the reviewing authority. The Federal Reformatory, Chillicothe, Ohio was designated as the places of confinement for Fazio and Nelson, and the United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania for Poteet.
The former sentences of Nelson and Poteet were approved -by the reviewing authority and the general court-martial orders thereon published prior to 25 October 1943, the date of the present trial. The former sentence of Fazio was approved by the reviewing authority prior to the date of the present trial but the only valid general court-martial order thereon was published four days after the date of this trial. The offenses by - the three accusecTwhich were the subject of the present trial were all committed prior to the dates on which they were dishonorably discharged.
They were therefore soldiers when the offense^ were committed.
It is now well settled that where a general prisoner is tried for an offense committed while a soldier and prior to his dishonorable discharge, such discharge did not terminate his amenability to trial . while in confinement under his sentence for offenses committed prior to discharge. (Dig. Ons. JAG. 1912-1930. sec.1326. n.657: 'CM156977.-Howell:	CM	173082, Curran:	CM	175471,	Evanco)
« * * * where a dishonorably discharged general prisoner was . tried for an offense committed while a soldier and prior to his dishonorable discharge, it was held that such discharge did not terminate his amenability to trial for the offense"
(MCM; 1928, par.10, p.9).	'
In a case decided prior to the Howell case just cited, the evidence showed- that accused was- sentenced to dishonQrable discharge, advised of the sentence and actually discharged prior to 30 November 1921, the date on which the reviewing authority approved a second sentence imposed upon trial for an offense prior to his discharge. It was held that except for violation of Article of War 94, courts-martial did not have jurisdiction
-9-
G0NF10LNTIAL
to try general prisoners for offenses committed prior to their discharge as soldiers, and that as accused had been discharged'subsequent to;the offenses charged and prior to the completion of his trial, such trial was void (CM 149349, Qgilvie et alt CM. 142257, Kolocklv: CM 126359, Sparks; CM 144.965. Jones; CM 152203, Acree). However, the principle enunciated in the Ogilvie case and similar cases immediately above cited, has been overruled by the Howell, Curran and Evanco decisions.
The principles of the last.mentioned.cases apply to the case under consideration. The offenses alleged in the present cases were committed by Poteet and Nelson and charges were preferred, prior:to the promulgation of their former sentences to dishonorable discharge, . by general court-martial orders dated 15 and 21 October respectively, although the date of the present trial is.subsequent to the date of such publication. . Fazio ‘however committed the offehses herein alleged, charges were preferred against him-, and he was actually' tried prior to the, publication of his former sentence to dishonorable discharge by; general court-martial order dated 29 October 1943. All three aocused were in confinement when charges for the commission'of the present offenses were preferred. According to the principles enunciated in the Howell and associate cases cited above, the three accused were amenable to trial by courts-martial for the commission of the offenses charged herein. To hold otherwise would result in allowing them;to escape punishment entirely with respect to these offenses.
Although the sentences herein imposed are, therefore1, entirely legal, those portions thereof adjudging dishonorable discharge and total forfeitures are now inoperative as the prior sentences to dis- : honorable, discharge and total forfeitures have been promulgated, and
have,effected the discharges and forfeitures.	*	■

10.	The charge sheets show that accused Fazio, is 13 years and 3 months old, and enlisted at Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, 7 January 1941 with no prior service; that accused Nelson is 24 years'4 months old; and enlisted at Akron, ..Ohio, 15 July 1940 with no prior service; and that accused Poteet is 22 years old and enlisted at Richmond, Virginia,
7 November, .1939, with no .prior service. The service period of each accused was governed by the Service Extension Act of 1941.
11.	The court was legally constituted and had jurisdiction of the persons and of the offenses. ^No errors injuriously affecting the substantial rights of accused,were committed during Idle trial. The Board of Review is of the opinion that the record of trial is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty and the sentences as to each accused.

12.	Pursuant to paragraph 5c, General Orders No. 37, ETOUSA,
9 September 1942, as amended by General Orders No. 63, ETOUSA,
4	December 1942, a sentence of dishonorable discharge may be ordered executed when accused is sentenced to confinement for not less than three years. By virtue of the same orders a general prisoner may be returned to the United States to serve a' sentence of three years or more. It is provided in War Department Circular 291, 10 November 1943, section V 3a and b that with respect to military prisoners sentenced to confinement in a Federal institution, prisoners under 31 years of age and with sentences of not more than 10 years will be confined in a Federal correctional institution or reformatory.
All other prisoners will be confined in a penitentiary. Confinement in a penitentiary is authorized for the offense of desertion in time of war (Article of War 42). The designation of the United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania as the place for confinement of accused Poteet, and of the Federal Reformatory, Chillicothe, Ohio, as the place for confinement of accused Fazio and Nelson, is correct. The place designated for each is the same designated as the place of confinement for the prior sentences.
