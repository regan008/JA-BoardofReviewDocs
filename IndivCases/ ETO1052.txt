(a) iroa.Lxs, *C* to *K* inclusive were received in evidence with the direction that the statements therein would apply only to the signer and would not be received or considered ea evidence against any of the others (B33), liaoh contain matter affecting other of the accused than the signer thereof.
In tha opinion of the Board of Tavist heretofore expreseed (CM ETO 134* Stump et el), the reading of such statements of accused may become highly prejudicial to the substantial rights of other of the accused. This conclusion is baaed on the familiar rule that t
“Tha confessions or admissions made by s oo-conspirator or co-defendant after the termination of the oonapiracy and in tha absence of the defendant, ore not admissible against the defendant as substantive evidence to prove h i a guilt. His confession, therefore, subsequently made, even though by the plea of guilty, is not admissible in evidence, ee such, against any but himself and even the most solemn admission made by him after tbs conspiracy is at an end is not •vidsnsa against accomplices’, (2 Wharton's Cr,
u.v.,sa«.722, p, 121J-14, and sec,728, p.1223),
Tha present ease differs from the Stump ease in that the statements herein were received in evidence with the cautionary instruction to the court that they were admissible only aa against the particular signer and should not be considered aa evidence against the other accused. Furthermore tha statements are few in number and so particular difficulty arises in the court observing the injunction ea to their uae as evidence against only the makere* Under such circumstances the evil of accumulating a “matrix of hearsay evidence* against accused other than the one making the statement is obvlatsd, Ths statements wsre rightfully admitted in eri denes (CM £T0 804, Pale tree et •1).

(a) Upon croaa-a ratal nation of Smith, a witaaaa for tha proaaautioa, his prior writtan atateaeat made to tha investigating officer waa praaantad to hia (R92). After ha admittad ita authenticity it waa read to tha court*
It contained eom» assertions ia conflict with hia evidence on direct examination. Inasmuch as Smith affirmed the making of tha statement it waa proper to place it la evidence and read it to tha court* Thera was no necessity of laying foundation for ita admission nor for proving it by other testimony (3 Wharton's Crim.Sv., 11th £d., eee.1359, p.2243)* However, it was admissible for the purpose only of impeaching Smith's credibility and was not substantive evidence of the truth of the matter therein stated (70 C.J., sec.1339* P*U53l Southern Railway Co. v. Gray, 241 U.S. 333,3371 60 L.KD., I030, 1033). Cautionary Instructions to this offset should have bean given to the court, but in this instance th# absence was not prejudicial to rights of accused (AW 37)*
10* Conduct prejudicial to good order end military discipline ia violation of Article of War 96 (Charge III), ooaaltting a riot in violation of Article of War 89 (Charge I), and Joining in a mutiny in violation of Article of War 66 (Additional Charge', are separate offenaee and not multiple chargee although growing out of the seme incident (CM £70 895, Fred. A, Davis at el).
11.	The Board of Review has had ocoaslom to examine into many questions arising out of and connected with the offense of •ooseaitting a riot* under the 89th Article of War ia two reeently approved holdings1 CM £70 804,
Qglctrcc at al and CM KT0 895, Fred A. Pavia at al. ( Salt holdings establish the principles that the offence may be eoamitted by solitary personnel at places other than 'quarters, garrison, camp and on the march*| that a person who is present at a riotous and tumultuous assembly where his presence ia intentional sad who saeourages the rioters la tha furtherance of the enter-prlee either by overt acta or sxhortstloms or remarks may be primm-feeie inferred to be a partlsipant| that a by-atander, spectator or observer cannot be held as e partialpent 1 that all partialpaata are responsible as prlnsipalsi that the offence may be icmalttcd by three or mere parsons and that the substance of the offense is the disturbance ef the public peace to the terror of the people* In view of the detailed and careful consideration the subject received in the above cited holdlxgs it ia not believed necessary to repast tha discussion of tha elementa of the effeaae la the instant case*
Colored American soldi era, ano^ wham were certain of the aceueed, made an attack with the wee of fire-arms upon mmabere of the military police deteahmeat on duty in the town ef Inanseaton, Devonshire, England on the night of 26 September 1943* The attack had bean deliberately and premed-Itatedly planned by accused without cause, except imaginary grievancea against the pelieemea who in the performance ef their duties had apparently incurred their animosity. There is no suggestiom or inference that say of tha military policemen provoked tha attack by either verbal threats or sets of menace.

That the disturbance assumed the violence and turbulence of a riot, as defined by the authorities, is an irrefragable conclusion*
The accused Geddies, Lindsey, Shaw, Blake, Austin, Barrett, Ewing* Martin, Tennyson and Hughsa ware aot only present at the rioting but were active and notorious partisipants* Thalr guilt of 'oonaltting a riot* is proved by substantial avldsnca which fully sustains the findings of the oourt.

ings of pillty oa to aasused Coddles, Lindsey, Chaw, Blake, Austin, Barrott, Ewing, Martin, Terwyscn and hughes of Charges I, II and III and their respective specifications, legally sufficient to support their respective sentences, but locally insufficient to support tho findings of guilty of weld ton aoe-ioad of tho Additional Charge and Its Specification 2, Tho Board of hsviev, by its said holding further concludes that tho record la legally sufficient te support the findings of guilty of accused HcEnlght and cifaba of Charge III and its Specification, legally sufficient to support tho sentences hut legally insufficient to support the findings of guilty #f amid two accused of Cbarye I, II end their respective specifications and the Additional Charge and Its ipacification 2. As te accused, ''arming and Tilly, the Docrd cf Bedew further concludes that the record is legally sufficient to support the finding of guilty of Charge III and its Specific*-tioa, and legally sufficient to support tho sentences, with oonfinsneni la a plats ether than a penitentiary, but legally insufficient to support tho findings af guilty of add two accused of Charges X, IX and their respective specifications. I approve said holding. Under the provisions of Article of War 50$ you sow have authority to order e—oullon of the sentences.
2.	In view of the fact that as to accused ttsinight, Gibbs, arming end Tilly the record Is suffielsnt only to support the findings ef guilty of an offence under the 96th Article of bar, I suggest that their respective periods of eeaflneaant be reduced to five years. Penitentiary eenfine®eat is not authorised upon conviction ef an offence under the 96th Article of Kar. tam I further suggest that thslr respective sen Wooes te dlahonor-shle discharge be suspended until the release of cash accused frea confine* asat and that Disciplinary Training Center t 29X2 be designated as tits place ef senfinsscat.
