HOLDING by the BOARD OF REVIEW RITER, VAN BENSCHOTEN and SARGENT, Judge Advocates
1.	The record of trial in the case of the soldier named above has been examined by the Board of Review.
2.	Accused was tried upon the following Charge and Specification:
CHARGE:	Violation	of	the 75th Article of War.
Specification:	In	that	Private	Raymond F.
Mieczkowski, Company "I", 39th Infantry, be-.	ing	present	with	his Company while it was
engaged with the enemy, did, in the vicinity of Cerami, Sicily, on or about August 2, 1943, shamefully abandon the said Company.and did fail to rejoin it until the engagement was concluded August 6, 1943.
He pleaded not guilty to and was found guilty of the Charge and Specification. No evidence of previous convictions was introduced. He was sentenced to be dishonorably discharged the service, to forfeit all pay and allowances due or to become due and to be confined at hard labor, at such place.as the reviewing authority may direct, for ten years. The reviewing authority approved the sentence, designated the Eastern Branch, United States Disciplinary Barracks, Beekman, New York as the place of confinement, directed that the prisoner be held at Oran, Algeria pending further orders and forwarded the record of triad for action pursuant to the provisions of Article of War 50%-»
3» The only question requiring consideration is whether the evidence shows that accused "was suffering under a genuine and extreme illness or other disability at the time of the alleged misbehaviour" which condition constitutes a defense to the Charge (Winthrop's Military Law & Precedents -Reprint - p.624) • This was essentially a question, of fact for the determination of the court. It declined to believe that accused's disability was genuine and extreme and as there is substantial evidence that accused at the time and place alleged was able to perform his military-duties, the finding of the court is conclusive on appellate review (CM ETO 492, Lewis:
CM ETO 1388, Madden(O): CM ETO U32, Good).
4.	The charge sheet shows that accused is 25 years 11 months of age and was inducted at Chicago, Illinois 10 June 1941. He had no prior service.
5.	The court was legally constituted and had jurisdiction of the person and offense. No errors injuriously affecting the substantial rights of accused were committed during the trial. The Board of Review is of the opinion that the record of trial is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty and the sentence (CM ETO 1249, Marchettl). The punishment for violation of the 75th Article of War is death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct. The designation of the Eastern Branch, United States Disciplinary Barracks, Beekman, New York is authorized (AW 42) but the.address should be changed from Beekman, New York to Greenhaven, New York (Cir.210, WD, 14 Sep 1943, sec.VI, par.2a, as amended by Cir.331, WD,
21 Dec 194-3, sec.II, par.2).
