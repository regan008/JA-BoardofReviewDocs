3* The accused is a member of 10th Troop Carrier Squadron, 60th Troop Carrier Group, 12th Air Force, stationed at Aldermaeton Airdrome, England.
The prosecution's evidence shows:
That about 9:30 p.m., 16 October 1942, Sergeant Anthony F. Bianco, who was billeted elsewhere, wels visiting Staff Sergeant Wilfred Buersmeyer in the latter's barracks at Aldermaston Airdrome. They were engaged in private conversation (R.ll). The accused came into the barracks and ordered Bianco to leave and demanded that the lights be extinguished (R.ll). There was no rule requiring extinguishment of lights at that hour (R.ll).
Buersmeyer and Bianco refused compliance with accused's demand (R.ll), and accused became abusive, using profane and vulgar language (R.ll, 12). He engaged in a scuffle with Bianco who fell to the floor, and when he arose he left the barracks (R.12, 13). Accused went to bed (R.12).
Staff Sergeant Lawrence If. McCormick wen charge of quarters on evening of 16 October 1942 (R.7, 12, 17). Bianco appeared at the orderly room that evening and informed McCormick that he (Bianco) was having trouble with accused and wanted to see Captaiin Edwin W. Barbee, Air Corps,
10th Troop Carrier Squadron, 60th Troop Carrier Group. Upon Bianco making compleLint to Captedn Barbee, the latter directed McCormick to accompany him (Barbee) to accused's barracks which he did (R.7, 16). Upon arrival at the barracks Captedn Barbee ordered McCormick to go up to accused's bed while he awaited below (R.7). Upon arrival at accused's bedside McCormick ordered accused to get up, dress and accompany him. Accused refused (R.10) and McCormick returned and reported to Captain Barbee (R.7). Captedn Barbee accompanied by McCormick, then went up to see accused, who wen ordered ty the Captain to get up and dress (R.7, 10, 12, 17). While accused wan dressing Captain Barbee went to the rear of the room and talked with Buersmeyer and other soldiers (R.7, 17). Accused took his gun from the holster, but upon being ordered by McCormick to put it back, he complied with the order (R.7, 10). When accused completed dressing. Captain Barbee>

the accused and McCormick left the barracks and went down to a waiting jeep. Captain Barbee ordered accused to get into the car (R.7, 9, 17). Accused refused and said "lam not going to let you make a fool out of me. I want to see Captain Sherwood” (R.7, 10, 17). Accused went back to his barracks (R.7, 10). McCormick, upon orders from Captain Barbee followed accused back into the barracks (R.8, 17). He found accused with his gun in his hand. The gun was loaded (R.8, 12). McCormick heard him "pull it back” and "heard it click" as a cartridge went into the chamber (R.3, 12). McCormick tried to take the gun from accused, but the latter kept McCormick at a distance fcy brandishing the gun in front of him (R.3, 12). Accused finally left the barracks (R.8) and went to adjoining barracks occupied by Second Lieutenant Robert A. Schneider but McCormick remained at accused's barracks (R.19). Accused opened the door and shouted "Where's Sherwood" (R.19), referring to Major Sherwood, the commanding officer. He was informed by Lieut. Schneider as to the location of Major Sherwood's barracks (R.19). Accused carried his gun which was loaded and cocked (R.19), and started to point it a3 he reached the vestibule,
Lieut. Schneider followed him end reached him in the vestibule of Major Sherwood's barracks:	He saw him take the cartridge and clip out of his gun and put the
bullet in the clip (R.19). Lieut. Schneider opened Major Sherwood's door end turned on the light (R.19). Major Sherwood was absent (R.19). The Lieutenant said to accused "Let's go back to the barracks end find out what the trouble is." (R.19). Accused kept complaining about "these shifts waking him up."
Ee had a gun in his hand, and refused to give it to Lieutenant Schneider (R.19).
He sedd "No, as long as he was going to die he was going to take the rest of them with him. He wasn't going to die edone." (R.19). Accused and Lieutenant Schneider went to the former's barracks (R.8, 12, 20). The Lieutenant proceeded to question some of the soldiers as to the cause of the disturbance, and while thus engaged, the accused turned to leave the barracks (R.20). He threatened McCormick with his gun (R.8, 12, 20). He again refused to surrender his gun to Lieutenant Schneider (R.8, 12), and held the gun on him and McCormick (R.12, 20). He also threatened to kill Captain Barbee (R.12). The Lieutenant and McCormick followed accused into the street. McCormick again demanded his grin (R.20), but the accused kept waving it in front of him and saying "Don't come any closer, Lieutenant, don't come any closer" (R.9, 20, 21). He pulled the slide back and cocked the gun (R.12, 20, 21), and had the gun levelled at Lieutenant Schneider's stomach (R.21). Several times, both in the barracks and on the street accused said to Lieutenant Schneider that he (accused) intended "to get Barbee" (meaning Captain Barbee) (R.9, 20). Lieutenant Schneider desisted in his attempt to secure the gun and went to telephone Captain Barbee of accused's threats (R.17, 20). Accused disappeared around the corner of the barracks (R.13, 17). He was not apprehended or confined until the next day (R.18) when he told McCormick that if he had not been there the night before he would have killed Captain Barbee (R.9).
The accused, after having his rights explained to him, was sworn as a witness on his own behalf (R.21). His testimony is a disclaimer of all memory of the events of the evening of 16 October 1942 (R.23, 24). He stated he had been drinking all day on 15 October 1942 and had remained in a public house until 1 p.m., on that day. While returning to the Airdrome in a truck, which he was driving, he was forced off the road by another truck and struck his head on the roof of his truck. He was treated at a hospital (R.22, 23). After leaving the hospital accused and companion secured a
234993

(98)
case of beer which they drank, finishing it at about 10:30 p.m. (R.23).
The next day, 16 October 1942, accused and companion secured three cases of beer which they consumed. Later, a sergeant who had five quarts of whisky, invited accused to his quarters, and the drinking bout was continued. After that he.claimed he had no memory of events (R.23, 27).
Upon cross-examination accused made contradictory statements (R.25, 26, 27,
28) but in the main the story concerning his consumption of intoxicating liquor appears to be fairly well sustained.
Private Adams, accused's companion testified that on the evening of 15 October 1942 he drank a few beers with accused (R.19). About 7:30 p.m., 16 October 1942 the witness and accused went to a public house where accused consumed alcoholic liquor, including whisky. Accused drove a truck back to the barracks, and it left the side of the road when it hit a gutter (R.30). Accused struck his head on the roof of the truck (R.30) and his heed commenced to bleed. Adams took accused to the hospital where the heed was dressed. At about 9*30 p.m., the two soldiers went to the barracks (R.31). Accused wanted to go to bed, and stated to Bianco and Buersmeyer that it was time to put out the lights (R.31). Upon Bianco stating:
"I don't have to. I am a sergeant" accused grabbed him end ejected him from the barracks (R.31).
Captain William Davis, Medical Corps, 11th Troop Carrier Squadron, 60th Troop Carrier Group, appeared as a witness for the defense. In his opinion it was possible for accused to have been suffering from amnesia as a result Of the head injury (R.37)and it was possible accused was unaware of his conduct on the evening of 16 October 1942, either as a result of amnesia or excessive use of intoxicants (R.35).
4.	A preliminary question arises in connection with pleading aid practice. The charges originally drafted appeared thus:
CHARGE I: Violation of the 64th Article of War.
Specification 1* In that Private John J. Orbon, 10th Troop Carrier Squadron, 60th Troop Carrier Group,
XII Air Force, did, at Aldernaston, England, on date of October 16, 1942, draw a weapon, to-wit, a .45 caliber Service Automatic, against 2nd Lt.
Robert A. Schneider, his superior officer, who was then in the execution of his duty.
Specification 2:	In that Private John J. Orbon, 10th
Troop Carrier Squadron, 60th Troop Carrier Group,
XII Air Force, did, at Aldermaston, England, on date of October 16, 1942, offer violence against 1st Lt. Edwin W. Barbee, his superior officer, who was then in the execution of his duty, in that he, the said Private John J. Orbon, did threaten to shoot 1st Lt. Edwin ff. Barbee on sight.

CONFif/Lu i ;AL
Specification 3* In that Private John J. Orbon, 10th Troop Carrier Squadron, 60th Troop Carrier Group,
XII Air Force, having received a lawful command from let Lt. Edwin W. Barbee, hie superior officer, to accompany him to the Orderly Room, did, at Aldermaston, England, on October 16, 1942, wilfully disobey the same.
The oath to same was made by 1st Lieut. Edwin V. Barbee on 18 October 1942. The affidavit recites that the accuser "has personal knowledge of the matters set forth in specification 3 of Charge* Violation of 64th Article of War and has investigated the matters set forth in specifications 1 and 2 of Charge:	Violation	of	64th	Article	of War." Thereafter the Charges
were re-drafted so as to lay original Specifications 1 and 3 under the 64th Article of War, and original Specification 2 was eliminated. A new charge for Violation of the 63rd Article of War and a new Specification were inserted. However, no change either in the form or date of the affidavit was made. For purpose of easy visualization the following comparison is shown*
Original Charge
Violation of 64th Article of War* Specification 2s In that Private John J. Orbon *** did *** on date of October 16, 1942, offer violence against 1st Lt. Edwin W. Barbee, his superior officer, who was then in the execution of his dirty, in that he, the said Private John J.
Orbon, did threaten to shoot 1st Lt.
Edwin W. Barbee on sight.
Amended Charge
Violation of 63rd Article of War* Specification:	In	that	Private	John	J.
Orbon *** did *** on or about October 16, 1942, ha^/yvf himself with disrespect towards his superior officer bv carrying a loaded pistol about the camp and threatening to shoot 1st Lieutenant Edward W.
Barbee on sight.
The accused, by motion timely made (R.5, 6) asked the Court to dismiss the charge under the 63rd Article of War against accused on the ground there is no sustaining oath to same. The Court closed for consideration of the motion and upon bfing opened, the Law Member declared "*** the court has decided that the charges as drawn will be acted upon, in that the matter has been fairly included in charge 64, as well as charge 63." (R.6). While the action of the Court on accused's motion is stated in inapt language, it was in effect a denial of the motion and will be so treated by the Board of Review.
The record shows that there was full compliance with the 70th Article of War, based on the original Charge and Specifications. When the report of the investigating officer together with the original charge sheet was referred to the Staff Judge Advocate of the Eighth Air Force, pursuant to said Article of War and M.C.M. 35 b, he re-drafted the charges in the manner indicated. There was no further investigation made after the amendment of the Staff Judge Advocate.
(100)
The 70th Article of War in pertinent part directs*
"Charges and specifications must be signed by a person subject to military law, and under oath either that he has personal knowledge of, or has investigated, the matters set forth therein and that the same are true in fact, to the best of his knowledge and belief. **** Before directing the trial of any charge by general court-martial the ^pointing authority will refer it to his staff judge advocate for consideration and advice. ***♦"
The relevant provision of Sec. 35 b, M.C.M., is as follows*
"*** No appointing authority shall direct the trial of any charge by general court-martial until he has considered the advice of his staff Judge advocate based on all of the information relating to the case, including any report made under 35 c, which is reasonably available at the time trial is directed. The advice of the staff judge advocate shall include a written and signed recommendation of the action to be taken by the appointing authority. Such recommendation shall accompany the charge if referred for trial".
Section 3A M.C.M. in part provides with reference to the officer exercising court-martial jurisdictions
"*** Charges forwarded or referred for trial and accompanying papers should be free from defect of form or substance, but delays incident to the return of papers for correction of defects that are not substantial will be avoided. Obvious * errors may be corrected and the charges may be re-drafted over the signatures thereon, provided the re-draft does not Involve any substantial change or include anv person, offense, or matter not fairly Included in the charges as received.
Corrections and re-drafts should be Initialed by the officer nuking them.****". (Underscoring supplied).
The gravamen of the offense under AW 6A is found in the clause* "Any person *** who, on any pretense whatsoever, strikes his superior officer or draws or lifts up any weapon or offers any violence against him, being in the execution of his office ****". The M.C.M. (sec.l3A) declares that*
(101)
"The phrase 'offers any violence against him' comprises any form of battery or of mere assault not embraced in the preceding more specific terms 'strikes' and 'draws or lifts up’• But the violence where not executed must be physically attempted or menaced.
A mere threatening In words would not be an offering of violence In the sense of this article." (underscoring supplied).
(Cf: Wlnthrops Military Law and Precedents, sec. 880, pg. 570).
The gist of the offense charged by the amended Charge and Speeification under AW 63 is found in these words:
"Any person *** who behaves himself with disrespect towards his commanding officer shall be punished etc." (AW 63).
The M.C.M. comments on this offense an follows:
"The disrespectful behavior contemplated by this article is such as detracts from the respect due to the authority and person of a superior officer.
It may consist in acts or language, however expressed. It is not essential that the disrespectful behavior be in the presence of the superior, but in general it is considered objectionable to hold one accountable under this article for what was said or done by him in a purely private conversation.**** Disrespect • by words may be conveyed by approbrious epithets or other contumelious or denunciatory language.
****"	(M.C.M., sec.133, pg.146). (Cf: Wlnthrops
Military Law and Precedents, sec.875, pg.567).
It Is therefore apparent that the fundamental difference between an offense under AW 63 and AW 64 is found in the fact that under the former the accused can commit the offense out of the presence of the superior officer while under the latter the accused must commit the offense not only in the presence of the superior officer but also there must be an act or acts of violence physically attempted towards the superior officer*
The offense of behaving with disrespect towards a superior officer under AW 63 is a separate and distinct offense from the offense of wilfull disobedience denounced in AW 64, and the offense under the last mentioned article is not a lesser included offense under AW 63 (C.M.218409 (1942) Bulletin, JAG - VOL.I, No.l, Jan-June 1942, pg.18). In the instant case the differentiation is more pronounced in that the accused was originally charged under AW 64 with offering violence against Lieut. (Captain) Barbee in that he "did threaten to shoot" Lieut. Barbee.
(102)
The concluaion appearB to be clearly deducible that there was Introduced by the amendment of the charges a new offense "not fairly included in the charges’* as received by the Staff Judge Advocate, and that such new Charge and its Specification is not supported by the oath of the accuser. Was the action of the Court in denying the motion to dismiss Charge II and its Specification an error requiring the disapproval of the finding of guilty? The amendment of the charges was the direct result of the report of the investigating officer. The facts reported by him make it obvious that the prosecution could not have proved the offense under Specification 2 of the Original Charge, but the facts did reveal an offense Tinder AW 63. The Staff Judge Advocate remedied this situation by eliminating the original Specification 2 and substituting Charge II and its Specification. In this respect he was acting clearly within the scope of his authority and duty. The question arises however, as to whether or not the Court obtained jurisdiction over the offense alleged in Charge II, when there was no sueciflo investigation of same after It was added to the Charge Sheet.
The pertinent provision of AW 70 reads:
"*** No charge will be referred for trial until after a thorough and impartial investigation thereof shall have been made. This investigation will include inquiries as to the truth of the matter set forth in said charges, form of charges, and what disposition of the case should be made in the interest of justice
and discipline.*****
The investigation required by AW 70 is jurisdictional and in its absence the Court acquires no jurisdiction and the proceedings are void ab initio (C.IS. 161728 (1924), Dig. Op. JAG., 1912-40, sec.428(l), pg.292).
While the charges form the basis of the investigation it is the transaction or event which gave rise to the charges which is the true subject of investigation. This conclusion is supported by: (a) The fact that "no appointing authority shall direct the trial of any charge by general court-martial until he has considered the advice of his staff judge advocate based on all of the information relating to the case" (Underscoring supplied) (M.C.M., sec.34 and (b) "The investigation will include inquiries as to the truth of the matter set forth in said charges, form of charges, and what disposition of the case should be made in the Interest of justice and discipline." (Underscoring supplied) (AW 70).The underscored words and clauses above quoted indicate clearly that the investigation envelopes the entire situation. It may be that the charges are inappropriate to cover the offense or offenses revealed by the investigation. Hence, the convening authority is empowered to amend and adjust and should amend and adjust the charges, to meet the facts, (M.C.M., sec.34) before referring the charges for trial. The only limitation on his authority in this respect Is that the "redraft does not include any substantial change or Include any person, offense. or matter not fairly included in the charges as received." (Underscoring supplied) (M.C.M., sec.34).This limitation prevents the
234993
- 8 - ;
(103)
insertion of a new charge which is alien to the situation revealed by the facts disclosed by the investigation or preferring charges against persons not originally included, but it does not prevent the convening authority from re-drafting or re-stating the charges so as to make them allege an offense or offenses supported by the facts discovered and shown by the report of investigation. An opposite conclusion leads to the absurd situation of requiring a new investigation which would yield the exact state of facts as the first investigation. It would be a futile effort, which would delay the trial and not protect any rights of the accused. This construction of AW 70 is supported in spirit by C.M.179U2 (1928), C.M.182078 (1928), and JAG. 220.26, Aug.30, 1932, digested in Dig.Ops. JAG. 1912-40, sec.428(l), pg.292.
It is, therefore, the opinion of the Board of Review that there was no violation of AW 70, in the instant case, because a new and additional investigation was not made on Charge II and its Specification, and that the Court acquired jurisdiction to try the same.
However, the accused was compelled to go to trial upon a Charge and Specification which were not supported by the oath of the accuser. It has been held that the quoted provision of AW 70, requiring that the charges be supported by the oath of the accuser is procedural, and not .lurisdlctional. is for the benefit of the accused and may be waived by accused either explicitly or by failure to object to the irregularity. (C.M. 197674 (1932), sec.1267, Supp. VIII. Dig. Ops. JAG. 1912-30; C.M.210612 (1939), Maddox: C.M.220625 (1942), Gentry). (Cf. sec.1267. Dig. Ops. JAG. 1912-30). In the case timely and proper objection was made. There was no waiver, either express or implied, of the irregularity.
The supporting of charges by the oath of the accuser is not universally required. U.C.M. 31 particularly provides that the charges need not be sworn to if the accuser believes in the innocence of the accused. In criminal prosecutions, in the civil courts the absence of a verification to an Information where one is required by statute, is ground for quashing the information, but it does not render the information void or deprive the court of jurisdiction, and, after committing error in overruling a motion to quash on this ground, the court still holds jurisdiction (31 C.J., sec.166, pg.648). The record of trial in this case fails to show how accused was prejudiced in any respect by the courts ruling which compelled him to stand trial on Charge II and Specification although it wa3 not verified. Nothing appears in the record of trial that accused's rights were injuriously affected by this irregularity in pleading. He was neither surprised nor mislead as to the charges against him. The accused made no attempt to controvert the prosecutions evidence which supports the conviction of violation of AW 63 (Charge II and Specification). He denied all knowledge of his conduct because of being intoxicated. Under such circumstances the verification of Charge II and Specification would have added nothing to his defense, nor does its absence injure him.
The Board of Review is clearly of the opinion that under the provisions of AW 37 the irregularity is no basis for disturbing the finding of the Court with respect to Charge II and Specification.
•JL-'i! i/'1~
5.	Specification 1 of Charge I charges aacuaed with violation of 64th Article of War in that he drew a .45 caliber automatic service pistol, against 2nd Lieutenant Robert A. Schneider. The evidence clearly sustains all elements of the offense - almost without contradiction. Lieutenant Schneider was accused's superior officer.
"The phrase 'draws or lifts up any weapon against' covers any simple assault committed in the manner stated. The weapon chiefly had in view by the word 'draw' is no doubt the sword; the term might, however, apply to a bayonet in a sheath or to a pistol, and the drawing of either in an aggressive manner or the raising or brandishing of the same minaciously in the presence of the superior and at him is the sort of act contemplated. The raising in a threatening manner of a firearm (whether loaded or not loaded) or of a club, or of any implement or thing by which a serious blow could be given, would be within the description 'lifts up'." (M.C.M., sec.134, pg.147).
It was a question of fact for the Court as to whether accused was aware that Lieutenant Schneider was his superior officer. Inasmuch as there is substantial evidence (see paragraph 6 hereof, supra) that accused was sober and in a normal condition, in spite of evidence of his heavy consumption of intoxicating liquor, the Court's finding is conclusive.
Lieutenant Schneider was engaged in maintaining discipline within his squadron and quelling a disorder. He was clearly in the execution of his office.
"It may be taken in general that striking or using violence against any superior officer by a person subject to military law, over whom it is at the time the duty of that superior officer to maintain discipline, would be striking or using violence against him in the execution of his office." (M.C.M., sec.134, pg.148).
The Board of Review holds the record of trial legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty of Charge I and its Specification I.
6.	Specification 2 of Charge I charges the offense of wilfully disobeying the lawful command of a superior officer. Captain Barbee relates the circumstances of the giving of the order as follows:
"I arrived in the barracks and found Orbon asleep in his bunk. Sergeant Buersmeyer was there, and several of the other men that were living in the barracks were up and the lights were on. I asked what the trouble was, and if it was true that there was a disturbance that night, and what it was all about.
So Orbon being asleep, I decided that there was something worth investigating, so I told the charge of quarters to go down and rouse him, and tell him to get up and get dressed and go to the orderly room, I wanted to see him. There was a little discussion on his part with the CQ about getting up at that time of night, but I went down myself to the end 108 of the room and told Orbon to get up and get dressed, which he did. He got up and came along, and I then went outside.
234.Q(bQiQ -
(105)
"He followed me out, as did Sergeant McCormick. I had a Jeep parked outside, and I got in the Jeep. Sergeant McCormick got in, and I told Orbon to get in, and said we were going over to the orderly room. Well, we had some words then. He asked me why we were going, and he wanted to see Captain Sherwood, the commanding officer of his unit.
I told him to come along and we would talk it over. During this period I wanted to—first off I wanted to be sure that he wasn’t just plain ordinary drunk, or what was the particular cause of this altercation, and I didn't— I thought he was prefectly normal up to the time he started to get in the car, and he sort of switched his mind on something else, and he turned around and I said "Orbon, are you going to get in this car", and he didn't say anything.'
I said "You get in this car".
Q. It was an order you gave him to get in the car?
A. Yes sir. So he immediately turns his back on me and
walks a few steps into the barracks. Sergeant McCormick was sitting next to me, and I said "McCormick, you stay with him, and I want you to go in there and get that gun of his off the wall".
Sergeant McCormick corroborates Captain Barbee's statement (R.7). The accused testified he had no memory of this occurrence due to his intoxication (R.2A).
It Is obvious that accused was informed that he was being taken to the orderly room at the time Captain Barbee first "told him to enter the jeep." He refused and then the Captain and accused "had some words". It was at this point that the Captain directed accused to get into the car. This order was but a subordinate order. The principal order was to accompany the Captain to the orderly room. It is indisputable that accused refused to obey such order. As a consequence there is no variance between the allegations of the specification and the evidence.
The evidence proves beyond contradiction that Captain Barbee was the superior officer of accused; that the order related to military service; that is was an order which Captain Barbee was authorized to give accused under the circumstances; and that accused did not comply with the order.
The offense of wilfully disobeying the order of a superior officer requiret the proof of a specific intent on the part of the accused to defy authority, deliberately and consciously. "A neglect to comply with an order through heedlessness, remissness or forgetfulness is an offense chargeable under AW 96" (M.C.M.,sec,13A, pg.148). Involved In the conscious refusal to obey the order is the ability of the accused to understand the order and to comprehend it3 nature and purpose and the formation of a mental design not to obey same. The accused must possess sufficient mental faculties to allow this process to come into play. Should accused's mental condition become paralyzed or is rendered inoperative to the degree that the formatioi of a wilfull purpose not to obey or to omit^a^xS^ful order, then it is impossible for him to possess the specific intent of disobedience which is the gravamen of the offeni
"*** it is a general rule of law that voluntary drunkenness, whether caused by liquor or drugs, is not an excuse for crime committed while in that condition; but it may be considered as affecting mental capacity to entertain a specific intent, where such intent Is a necessary element of the offence.***" (M.C.M.,sec,126,pg.l35).
10*
The evidence on behalf of the accused undoubtedly shows that he engaged in a severe drinking bout for approximately two days prior to the time of the alleged offense, and that during such period he consumed a considerable amount of intoxicating liquor. He also met with a head injury the day prior to the incident giving rise to the charge. There is professional evidence that the use of intoxicants and the blow on the head might have produced temporary amnesia or coma (R.35, 36, 37) although there is no specific opinion or diagnosis that accused was suffering from amnesia or was in a coma when he failed to comply with Captain Barbee's orders. Accused claims entire lack of memory of his conduct on this occasion (R.24).
Opposed to this evidence is the statement of Sergeant McCormick that accused was not drunk on the evening of 16 October 1942, and that he (McCormick)did not see any difference in his condition the morning after (R.9); Staff Sergeant Buersmeyer's opinion that accused was not drunk (R.15); and Captain Barbee's testimony that accused's actions were not such as to lead him (Barbee) to believe accused was drunk and his declaration that accused was perfectly normal (R.18).
It is thus apparent that there is a conflict in the evidence as to whether accused was drunk and as to the degree of his drunkenness at the time the order was given to him. It was the duty and function of the court to determine from this evidence whether accused possessed at the time the order was given him the degree of sobriety as would permit him to understand the order and its nature and purpose and also whether he understood it was given to him by a superior officer. The Court was the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses, and the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. Particularly was it its duty to resolve all conflicts in the evidence.
The function of the Board of Review in reviewing this case is stated in an approved holding thus:
"The Board of Review, in scrutinizing proof and the bases of inferences does not weigh evidence or usurp the functions of courts and reviewing authorities in determining controverted questions of fact. In its capacity of an appellate body, it must, however, in every case determine whether there is evidence of record legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty (AW 50£). If any part of a finding of guilty rests on an inference of fact, it is the duty of the Board of Review to determine whether there is in the evidence a reasonable basis for the inference." (C.M.150828, Robles: C.M.150100, Bruch: C.M.150298,
Johnson: C.M.151502, Gags; C.M.152797, Viens: C.M.154854, Wilson: C.M.156009, Green: C.M.206522, Young: C.M.207591,
Nash et al).
The present case is clearly distinguishable from C.M.223336(1942), (Bul.JAG. Vol.I, No.3, pg.159). In that case there was "no evidence in the record of trial from which an inference might properly be drawn that accused, at the time of hi a acts, had mental capacity to understand the orders or that
he was capable of entertaining the specific Intent willfully and intentionally to disobey them." In the Instant case there Is the testimony of three witnesses that accused did not appear drunk and that his appearance was normal. The Court elected to believe this testimony as against that of the defense, and its finding is binding on the Board of Review,
The Board of Review is of the opinion that the record is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty of Charge I and its Specification 2.
7,	Charge II and Specification charges accused with violation of AW 63 in that he "did *** behave himself with disrespect towards his superior officer by carrying a loaded pistol about the camp and threatening to shoot 1st Lieutenant Edward W, Barbee on sight," The evidence, without contradiction, discloses the fact that accused, at the time and place alleged, went about the vicinity of his barracks threatening to shoot Lieutenant Barbee on sight and that he was armed with a pistol which at times carried a live shell in its chamber, H.C.M., sec,133, pg.147 describes the element of the offense thus:
"The disrespectful behavior contemplated by this article is such as detracts from the respect due to the authority and person of a superior officer. It may consist in acts or language, however expressed.****
It is not essential that the disrespectful behavior be in the presence of the superior, but in general it is considered objectionable to hold one accountable under this article for what was said or done by him in a purely private conversation,**** Disrespect by words may be conveyed by approbious epithets or other contumelious or denunciatory language.****"
There can be no question that the threats repeatedly expressed by accused to shoot Captain Barbee on sight constitutes disrespectful behavior within the meaning of the article. It is difficult to imagine conduct or language more indicative of scorn and lack of respect. "It is also not essential that the disrespect be intentional: a failure to show a proper respect to the commander, through ignorance, carelessness, bad manners, or no manners, may, equally with a deliberate act, constitute an offense under the article". (Winthrops Military Law and Precedents, sec.875, pg.567).
Inasmuch as it is not necessary to prove a specific- intent on the part of accused, his claimed drunkenness could not minimize his offense.
It is the opinion of the Board of Review that the record of trial is legally sufficient to sustain the findings of guilty with respect to Charge II and Specification.
8,	For the reasons stated the Board of Review holds that the record of trial is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty and the sentence. The court was legally constituted and had jurisdiction of the offenses involved. No error injuriously affecting the substantial rights of the accused were committed during the trial.

9.	The sentence of the court, which has beqn approved by the reviewing authority, is legal. The accused, Orbon, was 33 years old at the time of the commission of the offenses. Pursuant to General Order 37, ETOUSA, 9 September 1942, paragraphs 5(c) and (d), execution of the sentence of dishonorable discharge will be ordered only when accused has been convicted of an offense which renders his retention in the service undesirable, and when he has also been sentenced to a term of not less than three years confinement. A general prisoner whose approved sentence to confinement is three years or more may be returned to the United States for serving of such sentence, without the express orders of Hdqrs. ETOUSA. The offences of which the accused has been convicted are peculiarly destructive of military discipline and morale and render his retention in the military service undesirable. Inasmuch as confinement is for 10 years, the execution of the sentence of dishonorable discharge, and the return of the accused to the United States for service of sentence are proper.
War Department directive (AG 253 (2-6-41) E), 26 February 1941, requires prisoners under 31 years of age and with sentences of more than 10 years to be confined in a Federal Correctional Institution or Reformatory. Inasmuch as the accused is 33 years old the reviewing authority correctly fixed the United States Penitentiary, Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, as the place of confinement of accused.
