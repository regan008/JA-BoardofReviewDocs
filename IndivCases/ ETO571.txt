3.	The undisputed evidence for the prosecution shows that at 10:30 p.m. on 20 May 1943 Joyce Brown of Goxhill Hoad (Goxhill community, Lincolnshire, England) an English girl aged 11 years, was sent by her father to secure some evergreens from a Mr. Stainton near Barrow Hall gates (R.8-9). She started out on her father's bicycle and after passing Thornton Crossroads met a "Yankee", also riding a bicycle, who shouted "Oie" and asked her the way to Goxhill. The girl identified accused as the "Yankee"• She dismounted to see what.he wanted and accused turned around and joined her. After telling accused the way to Goxhill, Joyce walked on and accused accompanied her (59-10). He gave her two tablets of chewing gum which she put in her pocket. After they passed Thornton Crossroads he asked the girl if she would go into a field with him but she refused, saying that’ she was iii a hurry. Accused, who had been holding on to her bicycle handle-bar^, took her across the pathway to a bank and laid down both bicycles (R.10), Taking her wrist he took the girl up the bank and lifted her over a hedge. Accused then went over the hedge, put his hand on her hips and pulled-her down on the grass.
He removed her knickers, unfastened hi's trousers "in the front", "took his Thing out" and put it between bier legs* Pressing her side hard, accused moved his body up and down for five minutes. Suddenly he jumped up and sprang over the hedge, leaving the girl lying in the field. She put Tier knickers on and went over the hedge but the "Yankee" and his bicycle had disappeared (R.ll-12). Joyce did not know what the man was doing when they were in the field, nor why he did it to her (R.16).
On the same evening two English civilians, Jack Robinson and Thomas Clark, both of Barrow-on-Humber, were walking on the road to Thornton Crossroad when they saw a man take a bicycle from the bank. He ran about 12 yards, leaped on his bicycle and disappeared. A few yards further on they saw a little girl sitting on the bank, pulling up or adjusting her underclothes which were down to her ankles* They asked her "Who is that man?". The girl began to cry, replied that he was a "Yankee" and that "He took off my knickers and laid on my belly" (R.16-18, 20-21). After ascertaining that the girl's name was Brown and securing her father’s name and address, Mr. Robinson took her to a police constable named Colllngham (R.17-18,2l).
According to the records of accused's organization, bicycle number 65694 had been Issued to him (R.18-19jEx.C). A bicvcle was "brought into the court-room and marked Exhibit 'D' " (R.191 Both Mr. Robinson and lor. Clark testified that the bicycle in court was similar to that ridden by the man they saw that evening. Although they could not positively identify the bicycle (Ex.C), the basis of similarity between the two machines was that the rear mudguard in each instance was painted white (R.19,2l).
At about 12:15 a.m. (21 May) in the presence of police constable Robert Collingham who was stationed at Barrow-on- Humber, Joyce Brown told Mr. Robinson that a "Yankee" had given her some chewing gum, had
CGNT1DENTIAL
(171)
removed her knickers and laid on her belly. Constable Collingham removed from her possession two tablets of chewing gum and returned Joyce to her home (R.22,24), The following morning he was shown by Mr, Clark the place where the girl had been seen the previous evening, A patch of grass in the field on the other side of the hedge was flattened down "as if'some heavy weight had been laid on it recently" (R»22-23), When questioned later as to his movements on the evening of 20 May, accused told Constable Collingham that he "went with a girl" but had not raped her, "After being cautioned" by Collingham (R,23) and told that any statement made would be used against him (R,25), accused made a written statement to the same effect. He further stated therein that he did not have intercourse with her, that he had "sucked her off11 and that she "*** did not put up any fight about it. In other words, she agreed to it" (R.23-24jEx.E).
Captain Philip Kremer, Air Corps, Headquarters Squadron, First Service Group was ordered by Colonel Pollard and Captain Martin to obtain evidence and to prepare the charges. After being asked by Captain Kremer if he wished to make another statement and being told by that officer that any such statement would be vised against him, accused made a second written statement to the effect that on 20 May 1943 he had gone to New Holland on a bicycle and left the village for Barrbw about 2200 hours. On the road between New Holland and Barrow he met a girl riding a bicycle, started talking to her and gave her some gum. He then took her into a field, removed her "pants" and put his penis between her legs. Upon his request she played with his penis while he "sucked her off. She got on her back of her own accord". After "completing the act" he returned to his station on his bicycle (R.25-26; Ex.F),
Joyce Brown later identified accused in a line of four or five men, all of whom were similarly dressed and very much alike in appearance (R.26).
Dr. Thomas H..Kirk of Burgate, Barton-on-Humber examined the girl the day after the occurrence and found no physical evidence of rape (R.6).
4,	No witnesses were presented by the defense and accused, upon being advised of his rights elected to remain silent (R,27-28),
5,	The evidence is legally sufficient to sustain the finding by the court that accused did, at the time and place alleged, unlawfully and indecently assault Joyce Brown, a British civilian female aged
11 years. The fact that an indecent assault was committed was clearly established by the testimony of the victim and by the two written statements of accused himself, the statements differing from the testimony of the girl only as to the manner in which the assault was consummated and as to the question of consent by the victim.
The girl, who was 11 years of age testified that she did not know what accused was doing when they were in the field, nor did she know why he did it to her.

"It is no defense that the attack was made upon *** one ignorant of the nature of the act. ***
The same rule applies where the party assaulted does not know what the act is. *** And even nonresistance is no defense to an ‘indictment for an assault with intent to take indecent liberties, when ‘the defendant is a schoolmaster and the person assailed a female pupil, and there is no actual assent. ***. Where medical practitioner had sexual connection with female patient of the age of fourteen years, *** it was held that he was guilty of an assault, the .lurv having found that she was ignorant of the nature of defendants act. ***" (l TihartoriS Criminal law, 12th Ed.. sec.809, pp.UO4.-UO5)
(Underscoring supplied)•
"Want of resistance on the part of the person assaulted does not purge the assault of its criminality." (5 C.J., sec.184-, p.723).
"Mere submission to an indecent act, without any positive exercise of a dissenting wiH, where, owing to circumstances, the person submitting is in ignorance of the nature of the act, is not such a consent as the law contemplates, so as to prevent the act from being an assault, and the age and the mentality of the subject of an Indecent assault should always be considered in determining the presence 0£ absence of consent."
75 C.J., sec,228, p.743) (Underscoring supplied)•
The question as to whether the victim consented to the act committed was a fact for determination by the court. The appearance of the victim, her age, her capacity to understand what had occurred and her truthfulness were matters for observation by the court. The court evidently found as a fact that she did not comprehend the nature of the act and the evidence was legaHy sufficient to justify its conclusion.
The offense committed by accused, namely an indecent assault upon a female minor child was clearly such an act as to bring discredit upon the military service, and constituted a violation of Article of War 96. It is not necessary that the specification contain an aHegation to the‘effect that the offense committed was to the discredit of the military service.
6.	The staff judge advocate commented upon several irregularities appearing in the record of trial and further detailed comment on these irregularities is unnecessary. The statement made by the girl before the witnesses Robinson, Clark and Collingham that the man "took off my knickers and laid on my belly" was hearsay and inadmissible.

"Statements made by. the victim of a crime, which are not part of the res gestae ***» are hearsay and inadmissible ****. There is an exception to this rule **** in prosecutions for rape, where the fact that the prosecutrix Immediately made complaint of the offense to a third person is admissible for the purpose of corroboration. Her statements as to the details of the affair are inadmissible. however. **** The rule. • however, doe3 not extend to the crime of taking Indecent liberties with a child, or to other offenses. The reasons for receiving such evidence i§ not present in cases of assault, other than rape cases." (1 Wharton's Criminal Evidence, sec.437, pp.685-686)
(Underscoring supplied).
Although'the'foregoing statement by the victim of the assault was in fact inadmissible, in view of the undisputed evidence establishing accused's guilt of the offense alleged, the admission of the statement did not injuriously affect his substantial rights. (AW 37).
7.	When the prosecution rested its case the defense "asked the court for acquittal on both the specifications and the charge" on the ground of insufficiency of evidence. The court "dismissed specification 2 and sustained specification 1 and the charge" (R.27). With reference to Specification 1 of the Charge, the denial of what was in substance a motion for a finding of'not guilty was clearly justified, as the evidence which had been presented by the prosecution was sufficiently substantial in character to warrant the court's consideration when making its ultimate findings.
8.	At the close of the case the. trial judge advocate asked the court to take judicial notice of the criminal laws of England, and quoted what purported to be Section 52 of the Offenses against the Persons Act of 1861, wherein an indecent assault upon any female is deemed a misdemeanor and is made punishable by imprisonment not exceeding two years with or without hard labor. It was also provided therein that such an assault may consist of carnal knowledge but need not necessarily do so.
The sentence imposed by the court herein, included confinement at hard labor for two years. The imposition of the maximum period of confinement provided for in the English statute justifies at least an inference that the court considered the statute as persuasive if not actually controlling, with reference to punishment imposable for the offense alleged. No statute of England can have any legal effect upon the punishment to be imposed by a United States Army court-martial (CM 210762, Valeroso).
The action of the trial judge advocate in requesting the court to take judicial'notice of\the statute in question was improper and such practice is not approved.

There is no Federal statute of general application or provision of the District*of Columbia Code denouncing the offense alleged. (Dig. Opsi JAG., sec.399(2), pp,246-247).	The offense herein described if not
listed in the table of maximum punishments (1928 M.C.M., par;104lfyt»797). It is stated in paragraph 104c, after'reference to the table of maximum punishments established by Executive Order, that*
"*** Offenses not thus provided for remain punishable as authorized by statute or by the custom of the service."
In CM 210762, Valeroso. with reference to the above quoted sentence, it was stated that:
"The word ’statute’ in the above sentence clearly refers to a statute applicable to courts-martial ex nroorio vigors or made applicable to such courts by some other statute ****** or competent order. The sentence quoted does not confer any validity in courts-martial upon a statute not otherwise applicable in such courts." (Underscoring supplied).
Therefore, when the court imposed sentence in the instant case, it was not bound by the Table of maximum punishments, or by any applicable statute specifically denouncing the offense alleged, setting forth the maximuia punishment imposable therefor and authorizing penitentiary confinement. However, the District of Columbia Code, after prescribing punishments for assaults with intent to kill, to rape, to commit robbery and for other types of assault, further provides:
"Sec. 22-503 (6:^8). ***** Whoever assaults another with intent to commit any other offense which may be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary shall be imprisoned not more than five years. (Mar. 3, 1901, 31 Stat.
1322, ch. 854, sec. 805)."
The assault alleged in the instant case is of a less serious character than the type denounced in the above-quoted section because penitentiary confinement is not authorized punishment for a violation of the offense under consideration, but is authorized punishment for commission of the assaults to which reference is made in the statute. Consequently, the period of confinement imposed for commission of the offense alleged should not exceed the maximum period of confinement authorized for commission of the more serious offenses set forth in section 22-503	(6:28)	District	of Columbia Code. As the court could,
therefore, have sentenced accused to a longer period of confinement, the reference to the provisions of the English statute did not injuriously affect the substantial rights of accused.

9* Accused is 22 years of age. He enlisted September 10, 1940 for three years and had no prior service. Pursuant to paragraph 5c, GO #37, ETOTTSA, 9 September 1942 as amended by GO #63, ETOUSA, 4- December 1942 a sentence of dishonorable discharge may be ordered executed when accused is sentenced to confinement for not less than three years o£ where he has been convicted of an offense which renders his retention in the service undesirable. An indecent assault of the nature alleged is such an offense,
10. The court was legally constituted. No errors injuriously affecting the substantial rights of the accused were committed during the trial. The Board of Review is of the opinion that the record of trial is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty and the sentence.
