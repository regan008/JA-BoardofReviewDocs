HQIDING by the BOARD OF REVIEW ElTER, VAN BENSCHDTEN and SARGENT, Judge Advocates
1,	The record of trial in the case of the soldier named above has been examined by the- Board of Review,
1
2.	Accused was tried upon the following Charge and Specificationt
♦	CHARGE:	Violation	of	the 75th Article of War-.
Specification:	In that Private Bernard J, Stack,
Company "L", 39th Infantry, did, at the vicinity of Nicosia,. Sicily, on or about July 31, 1943* run away from his Company which was then engaged with the enemy, and did not return ymtil after the engagement had been concluded.
He pleaded not guilty to and was found guilty of the Charge and Specification, , No evidence of previous convictions was introduced, * He was sentenced t® be dishonorably discharged the service, to forfeit all pay ani allowances due or to become due and to be confined at hard labor for life at such place as the reviewing authority may direct. The reviewing authority1approved the sentence, reduced the period of confinement to 20 years,designated the Eastern Branch, United States Disciplinary1 Barracks, Beekman, New York as the place of confinement, ordered the prisoner be held at Oran, Algeria pending further orders and forwarded the record,of trial for action pursuant to the provisions of Article of War 5®^
3» Accused is charged with running away from his company on or about 31 July 1943 'which was then engaged with the enemy"# The phrase "engaged with the enemy* is equivalent to the phrase "before the enemy" as used in the 75ih Article of War. It is properly construed as an allegation of place as well as time (CM France,28 January 1919, OAJAfi 201-1200, Francis Slaglet CM ETO 1249 Marchetti).
4.	On 29 July 1943* the 9th Division, when in the vicinity of Nicosia, Sicily, received orders to relieve the >lst Division which was in the line near that place. On 30 July, the 39th Infantry, a unit of -the 9th Division, moved in the direction of the front lines. Company lives a part of the third battalion. The first and second battalions of the regiment went into the lines. The third battalion was -in reserve ■although at the time, the disposition was not known". Artillery fire could then be seen although shells did not fall close enough to Company L to require dispersion of the men* On the morning of 31 Jhly the first and second battalions attacked the enemy and the third battalion went into the lines prepared to attack. Company L was then under artillery fire. Later on that day it actively engaged the enemy# It was in combat until tne engagement ended on 6 August (R6-8).
Accused, on 30 July was a member of Company L as a "basic" in the weapons platoon. , He was present with his platoon when it moved forward on that date in the direction of the battle line (r6,9). On the march at a point about 4 miles from Nicosia he received permission to "drop out" to defecate (R9,ll). After-relieving himself he remained in the area about 30 minutes and then continued his march. Approximately a quarter of a mile further in advance he again stopped to defecate but this time he did not attempt to rejoin his unit. He remained in the vicinity of this point the balance of the day (Friday 3° July), all of the next day (Saturday 31 July) and until Sunday 1 August. On the later date he commenced his wanderings about the island of Sicily, as he claimed, in search of his unit, but inasmuch as he did not discover it, he went to a central position in the island where he remained *(Ell,20j Matherly testimony). He declared in his testimony:	"Since I couldn't find them and
I heard the fighting in Sicily was all over, I did not feel so strongly about finding them. In other words, I gave up the search"(Rll). About 30 days expired before accused returned to hie organization by reporting into his Battalion headquarters (R7)»	...»
Accused was given permission to be absent from his unit for the purpose of defecating only. He received no general authority to leave his command (R7,9,20| Matherly testimony). The morning report of the company showed accused was absent without official leave on 31 July and returned to duty on 31 August (R7).
(a)	- The Specification alleges that accused ran away from his company "on or about $1 July 1943*» The proof is clear that he departed on the 30 July when fie failed to return to his unit after he had been granted permission to leave the line for a special limited purpose. The
-2-
(281)
variance is non-prejudicial. The gravamen of the offense charged is accused's act in running away from his company when it was before the enemy; the duration of his subsequent absence is immaterial (CMETO 1249« Marchetti), The phrase "on or about" fixed the time of the 1 offense with the necessary degree of accuracy to inform accused when he committed the offense with which he was charged and to enable him to identify the offense on a plea of double jeopardy in any subsequent proceeding (Winthrop's Military Law and Precedents - Repri.nt-p.i38;
Berger v. United States 295 U.S. 78, 82} 79 L.Ed.1314,1318; 31 CT secs,
212,454. pp.682,841).
, While his platoon was advancing accused left it under special permission of Staff Sergeant Matherly for a particular limited purpose which contemplated an absence of short duration within immediate contact distance of .the platoon,_ He .did not return .andthereafter remained away from the platoon,for over thirty days,	The,offense of ,"running
away* from his command can only be committed when a soldier is "before the enemy" when he departs from his.command. Accused obtained permission to fall out from the ranks, of his platoon temporarily for the purpose of answering a call of nature. Such permission was not a complete severance of his association with his platoon,or of control over him by his superior officers. He remained with his platoon while acting within the authority of the permission granted him by Matherly, ' When he failed to rejoin his company and continue with it, he "ran away" from
his company within the purview of the 75th Article of War,
• *
(b)	» The evidence is clear that accused and .his company were on 30 July 1943 advancing towards the front as part of a movement intended to relieve the 1st Division, then in the battle-line. At that time artillery fire was visible. ,The 39th Infantry was in the process of performing a definite tactical mission. Accused's battalion was-supporting the first and second batallions in the carrying out of that mission, Although it was "in re-serve" the battalion including Company L was tactically "before the enemy",
"Actual engagement with the enemy at the time of the commission of the offense is not an essential prerequisite to conviction under AW 75* 80 long as there was a 'real contact with the enemy,' as the term is reasonably used. C.M.I26528 .	(1919)." (Dig.Op.JAG, 1912-1940, sec.433
(3). P.304)).

(Cft 01 France, 26 May 1919, 0AJA3 201-4498, Domlnidc; CM France 28 January 1919. OAJAJ 201-1200, Slagle’I.
(c)	- Conduct constituting an offense under the 75th. Article of War must be the exercise of a conscious, voluntary will on the part of the offender1 (linthrop'a Military Law and Precedents - Reprint-p,623), There
> * -

(282)
is substantial evidence in the instant case to support the.finding that accused's failure io return to and accompany his platoon into battle was a deliberate, conscious act on his part#
. The record.exhibits, an attempt by the prosecution to bring home to the accused, knowledge that his platoon, at the time he ran away from it was under orders to proceed into the battle line. Much of the evidence on this point is hearsay and inadmissible. However, such proof is not necessary.	.	.	.	,	_	,
■It is not requisite that the accused should be in terms informed just when and where the fighting with the enemy is to take place. It is not customary for soldiers to be so informed. Where the general position of the enemy was a matter of common knowledge, and when the accused's company was moving in that direction, with identification tags changed to conceal the division to which it belonged, it was evidence enough that his company was expected shortly.to be in combat. C.M.126112, C.M.126113 (1919).*
_ • (Dig.0p.JAG, 1912-1940, sec.433(2). P.3°3))*
(d)	- Accused's evidence is obviously an attempt to establish the fact that "he was suffering under a genuine and extreme illness or other disability at the time of the alleged misbehavior", . Such ultimate fact, if proved, would be a defense to the charge (Winthrop's Military _ Law and Precedents- Reprint-p.624). However, such defense presents an issue of fact, which is peculiarly,within the province of the court to resolve either for or against accused. In this instance the court by.its finding rejected accused's evidence. 'The Board of Review is bound by. such finding if there is competent substantial evidence in the record to sustain it (CM 211586, Gerbert CM	Wedmorei CM 192609, Rehearing
(1930), Dig.Op.JAG, 1912-1940, sec.408(4), p.259j CM ETO I32, Kelly and Hyde. CM ETO 527» Astrella). While undoubtedly accused was suffering from a "mild form of dysentery* (Ell) on 30 July, in the opinion of Captain John G. Stall, Medical Corps, he was not incapacitated to the extent of preventing him from continuing his march. There was no permanency in his affliction as shown by X-ray examination made at a considerably later date (R19). .By his own testimony.accused remained over two days in the area where he left.his company without attempting to seek medicaljid. .Under these circumstances the finding of the court should not be disturbed by the Board of Review (CM ETO 1409, Mieczkowski).
.5. The charge sheet shows that accused is twenty-seven years, five montns of age and was inducted at Fort Dix, New Jersey on 24 January 1941* He had no prior service.

6* The court was legally constituted and had jurisdiction of the person and offense* No errors injuriously affecting the substantial rights of the accused were committed during the trial*
The Board of Review is of the opinion that the record of trial is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty anfl the sentence as reduced by the reviewing authority. The sentence imposed is authorized (AW 75). Violations of the 75th Article of War constitute military offenses) hence confinement in the Eastern Branch Disciplinary Barracks is proper* However, the address thereof should be changed to Greenhaven, New York (Cir.210, WD, 19 Sep 1943» sec.Vl* par.2a,as amended by Cir»331, TO, 21 Dec 1943. sec.II, par.2).
