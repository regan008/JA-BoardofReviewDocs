Lavalle, 330th Bombardment Squadron, 93rd Bombardment Group, during which game the sergeant cashed for accused a check on Barclays Bank for tlO signed at that time by accused. Later in the game Lavalle returned the check to accused, took from him another check (Pros.Ex.3) for L20, and gave him another L10, making a total of 120 (R9,ll). Accused who said he had moijev in the bank, asked the sergeant to hold the check until he (accused) went to the bank the next day to draw the money himself to pick up the check.
On the following evening, 12 August 1943, a similar game took place in the same "room. Accused and the sergeant were both playing and again the sergeant cashed for accused a further check on the same bank (Pros.Ex.4), for 110; accused saying "he had not had time to go to the bank that day",' The sergeant presented both checks at the bank for payment which wa3 refused on each check as accused had no account at the bank. Accused did not redeem the checks (RIO) (Specifications 3 and 4> Charge II).
First Lieutenant William L. Stahl, 5th Complement Squadron, mess officer of the officers’ mess at AAF 104 testified that accused gave him a check on 13 August 1943 (Pros,Ex.5) to cash for him (R14) and that he gave accused English money for it. Accused left.the impression with "the Lieutenant that it could be cashed at anytime but that he would rather It be held until the following Saturday. The Lieutenant personally presented the check to the bark for payment (R15) which was refused (R14) (Specification 5, Charge II).
First Lieutenant Larry R. Smith, Air Corps, 328th Bombardment Squadron, 93rd Bombardment Group, testified that the checks (Pros.Exs. 3, 4 and 5) were taken from his check-book as shown by their numbers; that the check-book was missing and that the check-book was on Barclays Bank where he had an acoount. He denied ever giving “any checks to accused to use (R17).	......	.
« \ \ .
Herbert L. Cawston, Assistant Manager of Barclays’ Bank, on which these checks (Pros.Exs. 3, 4 and 5) were drawn, testified that he had investigated these checks and that.the signer“of~t£e checks (accused) did not have and had never had, an account with his bank (R18). When these checks were presented at the bank/ payment was refused because "drawer had no account with us" (R19).	,
4.	Accused stated he "did not wish to take the stand", when his
rights as a witness were explained to him by the law member of the court (R22).	,	.	>'
5.	Several errors and irregularities as shown ty the record of trial have been noted by the Staff Judge Advocate and Theater Judge Advocate in their reviews. They were all minor and non-prejudicial. They will not be commented upon further. / '

6.	The accused pleaded guilty to an unauthorized absence for 22 days and such absence without leave is also clearly shown by competent evidence.
The evidence also is clear and convincing that he issued three separate checks without permission or authority out of the check-book of another officer. For each of said checks he received money on his representations that he had funds on deposit in the bank on which he had drawn them. Payment of the three checks was refused when presented at the drawee bank for the reason that accused did not then have nor did he ever have any account thereat,
7.	The charge sheet shows that accused is 21 years 11 months of age and that he served as an enlisted man two years and one month as of 6 August 19AO. Appointed Second Lieutenant, Army of the United States, 5 August 1942 at Miami Beach, Florida.
8.	The court was legally constituted and had jurisdiction of the person and the offenses. No errors injuriously affecting the substantial rights of the accused were committed during the trial. The Board of Review is of the opinion that the record of trial is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty and the sentence.
9.	The confirmed sentenceof accused includes confinement at hard labor for two years in the Eastern Branch, United States Disciplinary Barracks, Beekman, New York. Persons sentenced to dishonorable discharge (dismissal from the service) and to confinement, not in a penitentiary, shall be confined in the United States Disciplinary Barracks or elsewhere as the reviewing authority may direct (AW 42).‘ Designation of the Eastern Branch,
United States Disciplinary Barracks, Beekman, New York, as the place of confinement herein is correct (sec.VI, par.2§, Cir. 210, WD, 14 September 1943).
