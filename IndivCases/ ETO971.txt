VIII AIR FCRCE COMPOSITE COMMAND.
Trial by G.C.M., convened at AAF Station 231, 20 October 1943. Sentences Dishonorable discharge, total forfeitures and confinement at hard labor for five years. Federal Reformatory, Chillicothe, Ohio.
HOLDING by the BOARD OF REVIEW RITER, VAN BENSCHOTEN and SARGENT, Judge Advocates
1.	The record of trial in the case of the soldier named above has been examined by the Board of Review.
2.	Accused was tried upon the following Charge and Specifications
CHARGE: Violation of the 86th Article of War.
Specifications In that Private First Class
Charles S. Burnett, 1253rd Military Police Co., (Avn), VIII Air Force Composite Command being on guard and posted as sentinel, at Army Air Force Station AAF-236, APO 639, on or about September 17, 1943, was found sleeping upon his post.
3.	The only question requiring consideration is the propriety of the designation of a Federal reformatory as the place of confinement. Paragraph 90b of the Manual for Courts-Martial provides:
"Subject to such instructions as may be issued from time to time by the War Department, the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kans., or one of its branches, or a military post, station, or camp, will be designated as the place of confinement in cases where a penitentiary is not designated."

CONFIDENTIAL
War Department letter dated February 26, 1941 (AG 253 (2-6-41)/, subjects "Instructions to reviewing authorities regarding the designation of institutions for military prisoners to be confined in a Federal penal or correctional Institution", authorises confinement in a reformatory only when confinement in a penitentiary is authorized by law (CM 220093> Unckel: CM 228072. Wallace).
4.	Confinement in a penitentiary is not authorized in this case for the reason that the offense of which accused was found guilty is not recognized as an offense of a civil nature and so punishable by penitentiary confinement for more than one year by any statute of the United States of general application within the continental United States or by the law cf the District of Columbia. See Article of War 42.
5.	For the reasons stated, the Board of Review holds the record of trial legally sufficient to support only so much of the sentence as,involves dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances due or to become due and confinement at hard labor for five years in a place other than a penitentiary, Federal reformatory or correctional institution.

General, VIII Air Force Composite Command, AAF Station 231, APO 639,
U.S. Army.
1.	In the ease of Private First Class CHARLES S. BURNETT (35487537), 1253rd Military Police Company (Avn), attention is invited to the foregoing holding by the Board of Review that the record of trial is legally sufficient to support only so much of the sentence as involves dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances due or to become due, and confinement at hard labor for five years in a place other than a penitentiary, a Federal reformatory or correctional institution, which holding is hereby approved. Upon designation of a place of confinement other than a penitentiary, Federal reformatory or correctional institution, you will have authority to order the execution of the sentence.
2.	The record indicates that accused has an excellent character and over a year of satisfactory service as a trained soldier. He stands convicted of a purely military offense. He definitely appears to have salvage value and under announced policies the dishonorable discharge should be suspended and Disciplinary Training Center No. 2912 designated as the place of confinement thus allowing him the opportunity to demonstrate his right to another chance to serve his country. When action is taken suspending the execution of the dishonorable discharge, the GCMO should be published.
3.	When copies of the published order are forwarded to this office, they should be accompanied by the record of trial together with this holding and indorsement. The file number of the record in this office is ETO 971. For convenience of reference please place that number in brackets at the end of the order: (ETO 971).
