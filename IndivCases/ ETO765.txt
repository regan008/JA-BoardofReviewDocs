3.	The prosecution’s evidence discloses that accused was appointed Post Exchange Officer at Camp Turner, Iceland of Branch Exchange No. 49 of Exchange 860-1 (R7) on 9 February 1943 (Pros.Ex,G: R16) and was relieved from this assignment 18 June 1943 (Pros.Ex.Hj R17).	860-1	is	the	Base	Post
Exchange of the Iceland Base Command and is the headquarters of all the post exchanges on the island, serving all sub-post exchanges from the one control location. It furnishes merchandise to the branch units, collects the sales proceeds and supervises the merchandising. It fixes the retail sales

prices of merchandise and maintains the records (R7). The sub-exchanges operate under a standard Lknual of Operations governing their management and control (Pros.Ex.A). Effective standard retail sales price lists of all merchandise carried in, the post-exchanges are furnished to all branches and are the prices at which all merchandise must be sold (Pros.Ex.B). The list is posted permanently in each exchange and is accessible to anyone (R8). Requisition invoices identifying the goods, the unit prices and the amounts debited to the officer in charge of a sub-exchange are issued with all deliveries of merchandise by the main post-exchange to the subexchange. The debits are based on retail sales prices only (R9) (Pros* Ex,C). Any profit or excess money is figured as overage and belongs to the main exchange. A fire loss is assumed by the main post-exchange; a robbery is passed on by a board of officers. Money received for merchandise sold at more than the listed sales prices is overage* Daily reports of sales on which the amounts of cash paid to the Base Post-Exchange are recorded, are issued to and retained by each sub-exchange as a credit on its sales accountability (RlO) (Pros.Ex.D). The total of the report of sales or cash "turn-in" plus the total value of inventory extended at retail sales prices equal the amount of the accountability. A one percent variance from the amount of total sales accountability is allowed (R14) • A monthly certified inventory is required to be made and submitted by the sub-exchange officers to Base Post-Exchange 860-1, The purchase of any item by a sub-exchange from any other source than the Base Post-Exchange is not authorized (Pros.Ex.A, p.13) (R7). All merchandise for sale in a subexchange must come only from the main exchange on requisition invoices and must be sold only at the prices fixed by the main exchange and shown by the issued price list. No credit sales of any nature are authorized (Pros.Ex,
A, p.14; R7).

Pros.Sx."E" contains the monthly inventories of the Sub-Exchange at Camp Turner, Iceland (Branch Exchange No, 49) for March, April, May and -for the period 1 June to 20 June 1943 J each with Inventory Officer's certificate. Pages 8, 9 and 10 of Pros.«£x,E evidence the physical inventory taken as of lay 27, 1943, of Branch No. 49, with Inventory Officer's Certificate dated Lay 27, 1943 attached. They were submitted to the Exchange Officer of Exchange 660-1 by accused as Sub-Exchange Officer (Rll). Unless they are individually_checked there is no means of telling whether such reports and inventories are true or false and thus the Base Exchange must accept them as true when certified by the Inventory Officer. No irregularities or shortages were ever reported by accused to the Exchange 860-1 nor was accused ever authorized by Exchange 860-1 to sell merchandise at prices higher than standard listed prices. The sales accountability sheets for Branch Exchange No. 49 for March, April, Lay and the period 1 June to 18 June 1943 (ProsEix.P) show no shortage or overage for larch (R12), a shortage of 141 kronur 30 aurar for April, a shortage of 180 kronur 36 aurar for May and a shortage of 4132 kronur 48 aurar for the first 20 days of June 1943 (H13). Accused did not at any time report any irregularities or shortages in the sub-exchange to his Commanding Officer, but just prior to 18 June 1943 such' irregularities and shortages were called to the attention of such Commanding Officer who made an inquiry resulting in

the removal of accused as Exchange Officer* This occurred dmring the absence of accused on leave in Scotland (Rl6),
4.	First Lieutenant Howard M. Wandrup. in charge of the Quartermaster commissary (Nikel) at Keflavik, Iceland during the period 9 February to 18 June 1943 testified that accused purchased pineapple and tomato juice, cigarettes and various other things from him during this period and produced books containing the charge sales slips (Pros,Ex,I) showing such sales by the commissary. The name of the organization for whom purchase is made is required to be placed at the top of each sales slip and each is signed by the individuals making the purchases. Pros.Ex.I consists of nine of such slips showing two sales to Hotel DeGink, two sales to 31st Ferry Squadron, four sales to. Officers' Club, and one sale to Transient Officers, on various dates. One was signed "T. S. Claros", one was signed "Thomas Claros" and the remainder were signed "Thomas S. Claros" which witness identified as the signature of accused (R18).
First Lieutenant Versie E. Fox, Air Corns, testified he was manager in charge of Hotel DeGink during April, Uky and June 19A3.	It was
'not opened until April. He denied ever authorizing accused to purchase any merchandise for Hotel DeGink and particularly the items shown on the two sales slips included in Pros.Ex.I (R19). Further, he denied ever receiving any such quantity of merchandise as shown by the sales slips or any of the merchandise from accused, or that accused was ever in charge of Hotel DeGink (R20).
First Lieutenant Francis M. Becktolt. testified that he did the purchasing for the Officers' Club at Camp Turner during the period 1 Larch 1943 to 20 June 1943 but that he never made a purchase from the Nikel Commissary; he never authorized accused to buy merchandise from the daid commissary for the Officers' Club. He did buy certain supplies at the Camp Turner Exchange (Branch Exchange No. 49) from the accused for the Officers' Club ana produced his itemized records of purchases (R21) being sales slips written and signed by accused (R22) (Pros.Ex.J) but denied that the items shown by Pros.Ex.I (Quartermaster sales slips) as sold to the Officers' Club were the items, quantities or dates of his purchases or that the Officers' Club ever received the items so listed as purchased for them
(R23)
Corporal Neal N. Fowler. 31st Transport Squadron, testified that he was manager of Camp Turner, Iceland, Sub-Exchange, (Branch No. 49) beginning 17 February 1943 and as such sold merchandise in the sub-exchange to those who came to buy (R27); that all items were not sold according to the standard retail sales price list. He identified a document as being written in the handwriting of accused (Pros.Ex.K) as a list of items given him by accused with the prices at which he should sell them (R28). The list describes 13 items and their respective selling prices, at which

priceswitness himself sold some of the items* Pros*Ex.L, witness identified, as a list made by him about 17 June 1943 at- the request of the Commanding Officer of Camp Turner, of all articles sold at "boosted prices" in comparison with prices set forth in the standard retail price list effective at Camp Turner (R29). "fitness contributed $20 toward the Camp Turner post-exchange shortage for April and helped make up the February shortage (R30). The I&y inventory showed a shortage of around 600 kronur (a kronur is $.1544)or about $92.64 (R49). When the shortage was revealed-, accused, witness and Private Duncan were present and accused stated he would add more cigarettes to the inventory than actually existed. An inventory was taken also on 7 June 1943, accused giving as a reason that the post-exchange- door had been left unlocked (R3l). It showed a shortage of between 2400 and 2600 kronur, lio cash was taken the night the postexchange door was not locked (R32). Accused insisted that witness ,,kick-in,, to make up the shortage (R33)* There were two keys to the sub-post exchange door of which accused had one and Private Duncan the other (R36). Witness, using Pros.Ex,C as a reference, testified that the selling price of toothbrushes should have been one kronur (R37) but they were sold at one kronur 50 aurar (R38). The document "Selling Price of Post Exchange Articles at 3BC Sub-Exchange No. 49" (Pros.Ex.H) was effective in general from March until 12 June 1943 (R39). Some cigarettes sold at Camp Turner, Sub-Exchange were obtained from the commissary at Camp Nilcel and some from the Olympia Officers’ Club. Uhile selling at the "boosted" prices, they had in their possession the official price list for that period issued by the IBC Exchange (R40).
Private Earl F. Duncan. 31st Transport Squadron was a clerk at the Camp Turner post-exchange beginning about 25 March 1943. He sold at prices listed on a sheet of paper given him by accused (R4l). He identified Pros.Ex.N, as being in accused’s handwriting and stated that it was given by accused to witness when accused left on furlough (R42). Among other orders and directions it contained the following* "Vfhen you draw supplies Friday, if you get new stuff, jack the prices up a bit". The April inventory was approximately 800 kronur short. ’’fitness received no pay in April for his work in the post-exchange and was informed by accused that the money had been used to pay part of the shortage (R42). Accused said they could make up the shortage on new stuff coming in and witness saw. accused add cigarettes to the inventory "that never existed in the warehouse". The figures of the final inventory were not the same as those on the inventory made by physical check. Accused made up the inventory and had the officer sign it (R43) as witness watched. There was an increase in accused’s inventory. Vfitness was present at the 7 June 1943 inventory which was short about 2500 kronur and he helped take the 20 June 1943 inventory (R44)» Vfitness identified pages 8 and 9 of Pros.Efc.E (inventory of May 27,1943) as being in the handwriting of accused (R45).
Private Robert R. Sheppard. 31st Transport Squadron, testified substantially as follows* That on 15 May 1943 he began working as clerk in the Camp Turner post-exchange (R46). He helped take the inventory at

CONFIDENTIAL
the end of May 1943« Accused stated to him the morning before he left for England '•that he was really pissed off—and that when he come back from England he was going to put the place on a paying basis". Witness saw accused's written direction to "jack the prices up a bit" (Pros.Ex.N) on accused's desk the Sunday morning he left for England, 13 June 1943.
The ink-written price lists on tablet paper (Pros.Ex.K), kept in the cash drawers for reference, were the only ones he ever saw or used until after the change of management around the middle of June when he saw the postexchange price lists similar to Pros.Ex,B (R4B).
First Lieutenant Michael Zop. 31st Transport Squadron, testified that he assumed charge as Sub-Exchange Officer at Camp Turner on 18 June 1943 at which date he took an inventory and found there was a shortage of about 2900 kronur. He had received since his appointment from accused and also from the Officers' Club, about 745 kronur and 79 aurar representing credit sales of merchandise (R49-50).
* First Lieutenant Edwin L. Hill. 31st Transport Squadron. Assistant Control Officer jj.n Iceland since 1 May 1943, testified he was a member of the board of investigation appointed under Army Regulations 450-5, to examine into the operation of Sub-Exchange No. 49, Camp Turner, Iceland, which inquiry was made during the last part of June and the first part of July 1943. The board examined the records of the post-exchange, questioned the employees, and also accused as the officer in charge. It also interrogated individual soldiers as to prices they had paid for merchandise purchased by them in the- sub-exchange in comparison with the required retail prices. Witness made an examination of all of prosecution's exhibits and prepared calculations thereon which showed an approximate profit of 6000 Isronur accruing as a result of selling merchandise in excess of the prescribed standard retails prices at Sub-Exchange No. 49 from 2 March to 19 June 1943. In arriving at this figure he used the information shown by each invoice and each item thereon checking the difference between the correct selling price as shown by the invoice and the actual selling price as shown by Pros .Ex.M.	This calculation was admitted in
evidence as Pros.Ex.O (R52).
5.	The defense introduced three witnesses. First Lieutenant George W. Knepper, Executive Officer of the main post-exchange in charge of sales accountability and other records- since 3 April 1943, testified that he inspected the -Turner exchange on Lhy 24, 1943 •	It looked in good shape
and the sales accountability records were well posted. His records showed a Lay shortage of 180.41 kronur and wnen accused turned over the Exchange to Lieutenant Zop the shortage then was 4132 kronur and 48 aurar (R56).
Second Lieutenant Ira Stein, and John T. Stevenson, Air Corps,
17th Airways Communication Squadron, acquaintances of four and eight months respectively of accused, testified they had never known him to do anything under-handed.

By consent, the honorable discharge papers of accused were received in evidence showing former service (Def.Ex.l). Accused remained silent*
6* Certain questions involving practice and procedure and the admissibility of evidence deserve consideration:
(a)	The order appointing accused as Post Exchange Officer of Sub-Exchange No. 49 located at Camp Turner, Iceland, and also the order relieving him from such duties (Pros.Exs. G and H) were issued by Headquarters, Thirty-First Ferrying Squadron. The commanding officer of a post, camp, station or installation is authorized to establish and maintain a post-exchange and to appoint the exchange officer (AR 210-65, par.46 and par.166). The Thirty-First Ferrying Squadron was stationed at Camp Turner (R15). Accused's appointment as exchange officer of sub-exchange No. 49 and his relief therefrom are clearly established by competent evidence.
i
(b)	Pros.Ex«A - "Manual of Operations for Sub-Exchanges and Branches" - and Pros.Ex.B -• "Price List and Supplemental Price Lists applicable to sub-exchanges" were received by all branch exchanges (R7,8,13) and therefore it is entirely proper to conclude that Sub-Exchange No* 49 received copies of same. While there is no direct evidence that accused had notice of their contents, there is substantial evidence which justifies the inference that he did in fact possess full knowledge of the requirements of the lanual and the proper prices to be charged the buyer for merchandise sold by him in the sub-exchange (R28,31,33,38,40-/18; Fros.Exs. K and N).
The Board of Review will not disturb such finding under such circumstances (CM ETO 132, Kelly and Hyde; CM ETO 527, Astrella).
(c)	Pros.Ex.L is a statement prepared by Corporal Neal N. Fowler on or about 17 June 1943 at the request of the Commanding Officer of Camp Turner showing articles sold at the Sub-Exchange at "boosted" prices in comparison with prices set forth in the standard price list effective at Camp Turner. It was identified and admitted in evidence without objection by the defense as part of Fowler's testimony (R29). As original evidence it was clearly inadmissible. However, the witness in fact refreshed his memory therefrom and definitely testified that the "boosted" prices were used at the sub-exchange and that he sold some of the articles at those prices (R29,30). Its use as an instrument to refresh the witness's memory was unobjectionable (70 C.J., secs.763,764, pp.590-592). Its formal admission in evidence was not necessary (70 C.J., sec.770, p.599, foot-note 57) but its admission under the circumstances shown is not reversible error nor prejudicial to accused's rights (70 C.J., sec.777, p.599> foot-notes
49 and 50).
(d)	First Lieutenant Edwin L* Hill, Assistant Control Officer of
I.B.E., made an examination of all Prosecution exhibits and based thereon made a calculation tliat an approximate profit of 6000 kronur accrued as a result of selling merchandise at sub-exchange No. 49 between 2 Larch 1943

and 19 June 194-3 at prices in excess of the standard price list. These calculations were admitted in evidence as Pros.Ex.0.	No objection was
made by the defense either as to the witness's qualification as an expert or skilled witness or to the admission of the exhibit. Questions as to qualification of Lieutenant Hill as an expert or skilled witness were waived by failure to object at trial (3 C.J., sec.74-0, p.825, foot-note 75j LEM., 1928, par.116a, pp.119,120)^ The exhibit was admissible ill evidence under the following rules
»**■** where books and papers are voluminous, a qualified witness may summarize and explain the facts shown by such books and papers when they are all in court and the opposing counsel has full opportunity to cross-examine as to the correctness of the witness' testimony" (20 Am.Jur., Evidence, spc.831, p.698. See also: 22 C.J., sec.625, p*537j Underhill's Criminal Evidence, 4-th Ed.,
' sec.239, p.4-50j LEM., 1928, par.ll6a, p.119).
7.	The evidence is clear and convincing and is uncontradicted that the inventory submitted by the accused as Exchange Officer of Post-Exchange Branch No. 4-9, Camp Turner, Iceland, to Captain Harold M. Shaw, as Exchange Officer of Exchange 860-1, for the month of May 194-3 was a false inventory and had items listed thereon by accused which actually did not exist, and that it was submitted with the intent to conceal an existing shortage. . This monthly inventory was a required official report, and the action of accused in knowingly preparing and presenting it is clearly conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman as denounced by the 95th Article of Uar (CM 12224-9 (1918), Dig.Ops.JAG., 1912-30, par.14-96, p.739j CM 20854-5, Polk).
8.	The record is also convincing in its showing that accused while Post-Exchange Officer for Sub-Exchange No, 49 of Exchange 860-1, deliberately, without authorization and contrary to regulations between 1 March 1943 and 13 June 1943 sold and authorized to be sold certain specified merchandise at prices in excess of the prescribed standard retail price* list and also contrary to the same regulations made unauthorized purchases from the Quartermaster Commissary. As a result of such unauthorized transactions a profit of 6000 kronur or more was produced. Accused made no accounting for same and has not paid over the same to the Base Post Exchange.
The evidence stands uncontradicted that during such period of time shortages resulted each month from the operation of the branch postexchange, which were known to accused and that he failed to take any proper action to correct the shortages.

Such acts and omissions of accused are "disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and military discipline" described in and punishable under the 96th Article of War.

10.	Accused is 24- years of age. He was commissioned 5 August 1942.
He had had prior service as an enlisted man beginning 29 July 194-0.
11.	The court was legally constituted and had jurisdiction of accused and of the offense. No errors injuriously affecting the substantial rights of the accused were committed during the trial.
