1.	The record of trial in the case of the soldier named above has been examined by.the Board of Review.
2.	Accused was tried upon the following Charge and Specification:
CHARGE:	Violation of the 93rd Article of War.
Specification:	In	that	Technical	Sergeant	George
W. Dungan,79th Service Squadron, 327th Service Group, did, at Wymondham, Norfolk,
England, on or about 18 September 1943> with intent to commit a felony, viz, rape, commit an assault upon Beryl Kedge, a female child aged about eight years, by wilfully and feloniously pulling her knickers down, biting •her neck, placing his penis between her leg3 and attempting to have carnal knowledge of the said Beryl Kedge.

authority may direct for five years. On 19 October 1943 the reviewing authority disapproved the sentence.and ordered a rehearing before another court to be thereafter designated. On 21 October 1943 the case was referred for trial to the present general court-martial appointed by paragraph 1, Special Orders No. 248, Headquarters VIII Bomber Command,' APO 634, 9 October 1943 as amended.
He pleaded not guilty to and was found guilty of the Charge and Specification. No evidence of previous convictions was introduced. He was sentenced to be dishonorably discharged the service, to forfeit all pay and allowances due or to become due and to be confined at hard labor at such place as the reviewing authority may direct for ten years. The reviewing authority, in order to conform with the sentence adjudged upon the first hearing a3 required by Artitle of War 5&2,' approved only so much of the sentence as provided for dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances due or to become due, and confinement at hard labor for five years, designated the Federal Reformatory, Chillicothe, Ohio, as the place of confinement and forwarded the record of trial for action pursuant to the provisions of Article of War 5Of*
3.	The Board of Review is of the opinion that the record of trial is legally sufficient to support the-findings of-guilty, and the sentence as approved by the reviewing authority.
4.	The charge sheet shows that accused is 28 years of age. Confinement in a penitentiary is authorized for the offense of assault with intent to commit rape (35 Stat. 1143; 18 USC, sec.455). As accused is under 31 years of age and the sentence as approved by the reviewing authority is under ten years, the designation of the Federal Reformatory, Chillicothe, Ohio, is correct ('War Department Circular #291, 10 November 1943, sec.V,3a).	.	*•
