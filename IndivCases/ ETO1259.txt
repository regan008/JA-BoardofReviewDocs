He was found guilty of the Charge and Specification. Evidence of three previous convictions, each for absence without leave for 52, 23 and 10 days respectively in violation of Article of 7var 61, was introduced,-two were by Special. Courts and one by Summary Court. He was sentenced to be dishonorably discharged the service, to forfeit all pay and allowances due or to become due and to be confined at hard labor, at such place as the reviewing authority may direct, for twenty years. The reviewing authority approved only so much of the findings as involves a finding of guilty of desertion from 7 July 1943 to 24 November 1943, approved the sentence, reduced the period of confinement to ten years, designated the Federal Reformatory, Chillicothe, Ohio as the place of confinement and forwarded the record of trial for action pursuant to the provisions of Article of War 5C£.
3.	Accused pleaded not guilty to the Specification (R5).	His plea
to the Charge was not guilty but guilty of a violation of Article of War 61. The President explained to accused "the meaning of his plea of guilty to the specification and charge of violation of the 6lst Article of War"
(R5-6). The Board of Review, having regard for its duty to safeguard the rights of the accused, will treat the' plea as one of not guilty to the Charge. .
4.	Accused was absent without leave from Lichfield commencing 7 July-1943 (Rll) and was apprehended in civilian clothes, bearing a British identity card, by a Military Police sergeant in conjunction with a British detective
at Blackpool on 24 November 1943 (R7, Pros. Exs. A,B). He admitted that he was an American soldier (R8).
Absence without leave having been established, the only question presented by the record is whether it contains sufficient evidence of accused's specific intent not to return to the military service of the United States.
In the opinion of the Board of Review such specific intent is clearly established by the evidence (CM ETO 656, Taylor; CM ETO 740, Lane; CM ETO 800, Ungard; CM ETO 823, Poteet; CM ETO 875, Fazio: CM ETO 913. Pierno: CM ETO 952, I.'osser: CM ETO 960, Fazio et al).
6.	The court was legally constituted and had jurisdiction of the accused and of the offense. No errors injuriously affecting his substantial rights were committed during the trial. For the reason stated the Board of Review is of the opinion that the record of trial is legally sufficient to support the findings of guilty and the sentence as approved by the reviewing authority.
7.	The charge sheet shows that accused is 24 years 11 months of age. Confinement in a penitentiary i3 authorized for the offense of desertion during time of war (AW 42). The designation of the Federal Reformatory,

Chillicothe, Ohio, as the place of confinement is authorized (WD, Circular #291, 10 November 1943, sec.V, 3fl).
