He pleaded "Not guilty41 to, and was found guilty of, the Charge and Specification. No evidence of previous convictions was introduced. He was sentenced to be dishonorably discharged the service, to forfeit all pay and allowances due, or to become due, and to be confined at hard labor for the term of five years.
The reviewing authority approved the sentence, but suspended the execution of the dishonorable discharge until the release of accused from confinement, remitted two years of the confinement, and designated the United States Disciplinary Barracks, Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, as the place of confinement. He directed that accused be confined in the U.S. Army Forces Prison Stockade until further orders.
The result of the trial was promulgated in General Court Martial Order No. 87, Headquarters, U.S. Army Forces (in Iceland) A.P.O. 860, c/o Postmaster, New York City, N.Y., dated 30 October 1942.
3.	The accused was on 16 September 1942, a member of Company "BB, 392nd Port Battalion, Transportation Corps, which was stationed on that date at Camp Haggi, Iceland. Captain Clarence W. Archer was accused' s company commander and Major Harold R. Low was Battalion Commander. Accused, and a certain Private Bartlett, failed to stand reveille formation of the company on the morning of 16 September 1942. Accused at that time was under restrictions (R.17). Captain Archer directed Sergeant Clyde S. Bradley to order accused and Private Bartlett to push a concrete roller over the company area (R.18, 23). The two soldiers refused to obey Bradley*s order (R.18, 23), and the latter reported the refusal to Captain Archer (R.23), who summoned accused and Bartlett to the orderly room (R.18). Accused, and Bartlett, were then ordered by Captain Archer nto push the roller** (R.18). In giving the order Captain Archer did not explain to accused his right to d emand trial by court-martial (R.20, 26) nor his right of appeal to superior authority in event he believed the punishment unjust (R.20, 26),
Accused admits he willfully refused to obey this order (R.28). Soon thereafter accused and Bartlett were transported to Halogoland, and were placed in solitary confinement (R.26) for a period of four days (16 September 1942 to 20 September 1942) (R.30). The guard book at Camp Halogoland does not show their confinement during that period (R.12, 13, 14). Accused escaped from confinement on 20 September 1942 (R.12). The charges under which he was brought to trial were preferred two days later (22 September 1942) but no charge was included therein based on the escape from confinement. During the period accused was in solitary confinement he was carried on the company's morning report ’’for duty” (R.$).

A. This case is a companion of CM: ETO 110, Bartlett of even date, and the evidence in the two cases is complementary. Upon the authority of and for the reasons set forth in the Bartlett case, the Board of Review is of the opinion that the record of trial in the instant case is legally insufficient to support the findings and the sentence.
5. As in the case of Bartlett, accused was placed in solitary confinement on a bread-and-water diet. After a period of four days this confinement was terminated by accused’s escape. The remarks in the Bartlett case with reference to this illegal confinement are applicable to this case.
